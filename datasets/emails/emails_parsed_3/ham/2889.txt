the

lead

pde
thi
is
true
for

function
mu

and
so
includ
gbm
mean

there
is
no

neutral

which
is
what
you
enter
if
you
can
hedg
the
drift
of
the
actual
process
is
irrelev
i
believ
your
concern
is
that
you
would
like
to
see
a
differ
option
price
for
mean
revers
process
thi
can
onli
happen
if
the
asset
is
not
hedgeabl
and
so
the
actual
dynam
then
need
to
be
factor
into
the
option
price
if
you
assum
that
the
underli
is
a
non
trade
factor
then
the
pde
will
have
to
reflect
the
market
price
of
risk
and
the
drift
of
the
actual

is
then
reflect

dear
all
i
have
a
fundament
question
back
in
my
mind
sinc
hope
you
can
give
me
a
convinc
answer
zimin
in
deriv
b
differenti
equat
we
assum
the
underli
follow
gbm
d
mu
s
dt
sigma
s
dz
where
mu
is
the
drift
sigma
is
the
volatil
both
can
be
a
function
of
s
then
we
use
delta
hedg
argument
we
obtain
the
b
differenti
equat
for
the
option
price
regardless
of
mu
with
the
b
pde
and
boundari
condit
we
can
deriv
b
formula
fine
no
problem
question
come
here
suppos
the
underli
is
trade
secur
and
follow
say
mean
revert
process
d
beta
alpha
s
dt
sigma
s
dz
apparantli
thi
sde
lead
to
a
differ
probabl
distribut
howev
use
the
delta
hedg
argument
we
still
get
the
same
b
differenti
equat
with
the
same
boumdari
condit
we
get
the
same
b
formula
not
fair
from
anoth
angl
i
can
deriv
the
distribut
from
the
b
pde
for
the
underli
which
is
the
lognorm
distribut
my
think
is
can
i
drive
the
distribut
for
ani
sde
from
the
option
pde
the
answer
should
be
ye
but
got
to
be
from
a
differ
pde
rather
than
b
pde
then
what
we
do
about
the
delta
hedg
argument
thank
