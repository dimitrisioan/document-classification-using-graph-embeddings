to

end
most
of

will

what
we
need
is
an

for

we
plan

thi
from

current
we
have
sever

either

the

the

the

the

our

for

are

price
for

alongsid

specif
soft

statement
if
the
credit
is
liquid
enough
a

will
be
gener
from

onli
otherwis
the
credit
will
be
map
onto
a
subset
of
liquid
credit
with
financi
inform
and
histor
price
movement
provid
the
map
and
weight
the
model
price
will
then
be
period
adjust
to
align
itself
with
market
or
trader
price
and
thi
adjust
will
feed
back
into
the
weight
and
map
composit
in
loo
term
we
could
think
of
the
system
price
for
an

a
be

the
key
step
to

such

will
be
establish
what
exactli
we
want
to

is
it
a

a

we

we
