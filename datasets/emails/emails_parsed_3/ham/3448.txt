re
steve
leppard
dale
my
recommend
is
to
make
steve
the
head
of
the
research
unit
in
london
we
were
talk
origin
about
septemb
but
i
think
we
should
acceler
thi
process
of
cours
anjam
will
be
veri
unhappi
about
it
but
we
can
not
manag
around
him
ani
longer
i
think
that
the
promot
should
be
combin
with
a
salari
increas
i
would
like
to
offer
him
a
signific
increas
that
goe
with
expand
respons
and
much
higher
visibl
a
salari
increas
will
also
bring
him
closer
to
the
market
we
see
the
market
for
technic
peopl
go
through
the
roof
in
practic
everi
locat
where
we
oper
a
contract
is
not
a
good
solut
in
my
view
it
creat
a
sen
of
fals
secur
for
both
an
employe
and
the
compani
i
shall
send
a
messag
to
john
sherriff

hi
vinc
hr
is
work
on
a
mid
year
salari
review
for
london
peopl
that
have
a
notic
gap
between
their
compens
at
enron
and
what
we
would
have
to
pay
in
the
market
for
a
replac
they
highlight
steve
a
someon
with
a
potenti
gap
particularli
in
light
of
what
we
re
see
in
our
quant
recruit
effort
for
credit
trade
and
research
i
d
like
your

on
the
best
way
to
make
sure
we
keep
steve
happi
and
keep
him
at
enron
there
are
sever
thing
i
see
we
can
do
give
him
a
mid
year
pay
increas
to
move
him
closer
to
market
i
m
not
sure
thi
is
the
best
way
to
go
especi
if
we
onli
offer
him
a
token
salari
increas
offer
him
more
respons
what
are
your
thought
on
time
for
make
steve
the
offici
head
of
the
london
research
team
with
my
move
to
eb
should
we
acceler
thi
i
think
thi
is
good
way
to
keep
him
happi
and
motiv
and
then
follow
up
with
a
more
meaning
salari
review
at
year
end
a
part
of
the
regular
process
that
take
into
account
hi
greater
respons
we
have
some
peopl
that
we
re
tri
to
get
under
long
term
yr
contract
with
a
month
notic
claus
obvious
anyon
sign
one
of
these
will
want
signific
up
front
compens
for
be
handcuf
we
ve
not
had
a
lot
of
success
with
these
here
in
london
and
i
would
prefer
to
keep
steve
happi
so
he
want
to
stay
with
enron
rather
than
contractu
bind
him
to
the
job
