said
morton

senior

director
capit
market
divis
at

global
financi
product
in
new
york
the
main
problem
with
the
exist
exchang
is
that
they
do
not
offer
a
suffici
divers
array
of
product
he
said
the
onli
way
to
control
the
risk
in
the
catastroph
option
is
to
have
a
diversifi
portfolio
of
other
contract
and
none
of
the
exchang
current
offer
a
suffici
broad
rang
of
option
to
provid
for
that
hedg
he
said
florida

can
not
be

then
hedg

way
that

mr

explain
the

might
be
more
attract
to
investor
if
in
addit
to
natur
catastroph
option
they
includ
option
on
other

he
said
those
might
includ
for
exampl
satellit
aviat

crop
index
mr
lane
said
for
the
insur
buyer
such
exchang
instrument
would
not
repres
the
perfect
risk
transfer
vehicl
but
a
long
a
they
are
quantifi
and
index
they
may
repres
a
good
surrog
he
said
the

could
also
be
use
to
creat
a
deriv

for

the
counter
securit

if
there
are
regular

the

similar

secur

sinc
they

there
is
a
belief
that

it
is
difficult
to
predict
when
mr
