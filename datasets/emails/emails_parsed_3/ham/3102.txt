i
can
pick
up
the
cost
of
your

from
the
research
group
budget
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
am
convinc
it
would
be
difficult
to
justifi
trip
per

i
think
that
we
should
go

one
contigu
stay
per
person
and
make
a
good
effort
to
make
these

of
a
hurri
a
regard
our
summer

over
the
budget
person
commit
mean
it
s
difficult
for
me
to
take
two
whole
month
to

so
if
the
cost
is
prohibit
i
may
need

longer
and
two
visit
seem
to
be
the
onli
way
i
can
do

the
situat

similar
for
kirste

ve
persuad
richard

pay
for
matt

it
entireti
and
i
ve
no
doubt
that
rac
credit
trade
will
pick
up
the
bill
for
ben
and
kirste
it
s
difficult
to
think
who
d
be

i
honestli
think
i
ll
have
difficulti
persuad
