re
the
consult
s
model
for
gari
hickerson
s
group
the
model
is
suppos
to
be
a
real
option
model
to
captur
the
valu
of
power
plant
of
genco
it
is
to
give
trader
a
better
insight
a
to
whether
the
market
is
overvalu
undervalu
certain
genco
stock
and
trader
can
act
accordingli
i
m
still
tri
to
find
out
how
trader
is
suppos
to
use
it
model
detail
the
model
take
in
all
genco
locat
power
forward
price
and
fuel
forward
price
and
use
garch
model
to
simul
one
year
daili
price
and
then
use
a
hourli
profil
to
convert
them
into
hourli
price
garch
model
paramet
are
estim
by
the
consult
use
and
separ
model
and
are
updat
twice
a
year
and
it
doe
not
matter
whether
the
simul
start
in
januari
or
septemb
use
these
price
it
will
determin
whether
a
unit
at
a
particular
locat
will
be
dispatch
or
not
depend
on
a
spread
of
power
and
fuel
price
and
b
whether
the
start
up
cost
can
be
recov
dure
oper
hour
the
unit
can
be
dispatch
at
minimum
and
peak
level
fix
o
m
sox
and
nox
i
don
t
know
what
the
last
two
stand
for
are
taken
into
consider
with
the
simul
dispatch
schedul
the
model
calcul
the
valu
that
can
be
gener
by
thi
unit
then
sum
it
up
across
all
unit
the
final
valu
is
the
averag
of
simul
and
it
take
about
hour
to
run
for
about
unit
after
our
convers
the
consult
promis
to
look
into
a
how
to
make
the
model
more
flexibl
say
to
allow
a
differ
time
horizon
b
reduc
spreadsheet
overhead
by
do
calcul
one
unit
a
time
and
not
save
all
the
intermedi
inform
a
of
now
it
save
everyth
on
the
spreadsheet
assum
the
garch
process
is
model
correctli
i
believ
the
methodolog
is
ok
though
it
doe
not
captur
most
of
the
option
my
concern
are
whether
the
price
process
are
model
correctli
i
have
to
get
more
detail
befor
make
ani
conclus
simul
are
way
too
few
unless
we
convert
the
algorithm
to
c
i
don
t
see
how
spreadsheet
can
handl
more
simul
i
guess
that
s
whi
they
contact
u
but
again
if
enron
s
buy
the
model
from
the
consult
compani
whi
should
enron
do
their
job
for
them
how
trader
s
go
to
use
the
model
output
for
thi
i
phone
jeff
the
associ
who
initi
all
these
and
am
still
wait
for
hi
return
call
a
relat
question
whi
the
model
horizon
is
one
year
we
can
either
overse
the
convers
but
not
do
actual
code
for
them
or
redo
the
model
for
them
the
problem
still
remain
that
how
trader
s
go
to
use
the
output
but
in
view
of
the
great
wall
of
china
separ
the
busi
unit
should
we
do
it
a
of
now
i
have
a
simul
model
take
start
up
cost
fix
o
m
rump
up
delay
into
consider
it
simul
monthli
price
use
gbm
and
take
minut
second
to
run
simul
for
one
unit
for
ten
year
time
step
it
can
use
forward
forward
vol
and
incorpor
season
into
it
i
understand
thi
is
debat
one
interest
observ
is
that
when
use
forward
forward
vol
simul
the
standard
deviat
is
about
while
standard
deviat
use
forward
vol
is
about
also
incorpor
season
increas
the
valu
by
about
sinc
most
of
the
time
cost
occur
in
price
simul
and
we
are
to
simul
about
price
process
i
hope
the
full
model
if
we
build
it
will
take
a
coupl
of
hour
to
run
for
unit
the
main
task
will
be
interfac
i
e
get
data
from
data
base
and
output
the
result
thi
is
where
i
need
most
help
