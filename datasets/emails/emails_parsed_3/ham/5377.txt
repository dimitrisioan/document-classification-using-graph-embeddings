much
academ
work
that
i
am
awar
of

address
these
issu
veri
briefli
i
think

come
up
with
a
way
to
defin
the
concept

appropri
discount
rate
i
think
it
is
import
to
model
enron
s
opportun
cost
of
capit
and
how
that
chang
over
time
the
liquid
of
a
project
will
affect
it
valu
in
a
veri
signific
way
when
the
opportun
cost
of
capit
chang
over
time
there
is
also
like
to
be
a
relat
between
durat
and
discount
rate
that
depend
on
