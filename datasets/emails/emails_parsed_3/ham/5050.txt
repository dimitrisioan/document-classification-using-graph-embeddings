are
a
few
comment
on
thi
note
deal
with
seismic
compani
wa
done
by
a
mark
peterson
who
is
still
with
enron
i
haven
t
caught
up
with
him
for
detail
but
it
had
to
do
with
underwrit
risk
of
no
sale
seismic
survey
time
is
import
interest
may
have
pick
up
in
new
survey
and
the
survey
compani
decid
that
they
didn
t
need
enron
anymor
becaus
they
no
longer
saw
a
risk
of
no
sale
d
survey
will
happen
where
there
is
an
abund
of
e
p
activ
or
be
spur

by
success
in
a

basin
while

continu
in
the
gulf
of

on
the

the
major
discoveri
are
be
found
in
the
deep

worldwid
the
shallow

play
have
been
look
at
and
work
for
year
they
were
access
with
the
extract
technolog
of
the
time
i
don
t
think
that
deep
water
sediment
deposit
system
were
complet
understood
to
even
begin
to
tri
to
justifi
look
in
deep
water
concept
have
evolv
quit
quickli
the
point
is
that
mani
deep
water
accumul
are
incred
larg
billion
barrel
accumul
these
size
are
like
those
accumul
that
were
found
decad
ago
when
compani
were
drill
surfac
structur
the
larg
reserv
are
need
to
pay
for
the
correspond
incred
expens
cost
of
deepwat
field
develop
i
believ
that
find
and
develop
cost
barrel
are
at
least
two
to
three
time
shelf
f
d
cost
in
the
gulf
of

thi
differenti
is
probabl
larg
with
intern
project
and
that
doesn
t
take
into
account
polit
risk
i
ll
look
forward
to
more
involv
