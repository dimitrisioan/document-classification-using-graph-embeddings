vinc
to
follow
up
on
the
idea
of

oper
to
get
hold
of
a
few
week
of
second

data
for
the
whole
system
to
see
if
there
is
enough
measur
consist
to
prove
one
of
the
idea
the
idea
follow
along
the
line
liter
that
when
a
unit
fail
it
will
introduc
a
shock
into
the
system
and
reduc
system

which
is
then
react

control
servic

in
by

the
drop
in

is
notic
across
the
whole
network
and
a
one
option
may
chang
the
phase
shift
across
the

the

is
constantli

off
howev
a
unit
failur
may
be
distinct
the
second
option
relat
to
how
a
unit
fail
wherebi
if
a
circuit
breaker
is
involv
a
in
the
case
of
uncontrol
shutdown
then
the
outag
will
caus
an
rf
pul
that
should
propog
across
some
of

howev
it
should
be

work
out

backtrack
on

part
of
the
solut
is
alreadi
proven
in
lightn
tracker
the
solut
may
be
made
more
simpl
by
detect
the
exact
point
on
the
sinewav
that
the
unit
fail
i
e
measur
the
three
phase
at
lmhz
and
then
send
the
data
through
a
dsp
thi
solut
is
more
complex
howev
thi
should
allow
unit

to
be
pinpoint

the
