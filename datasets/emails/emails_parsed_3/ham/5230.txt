how
would
you
sum

your
approach
to

analyt
most
of
our
project
are
set
up
to
help
busi
that
face
massiv
uncertainti
of
some
kind
decis
analysi
help
peopl
explor
problem
and
redesign
their
decis
make
process
to
increas
the
chanc
of
them
make
the
right
choic
for
exampl
imagin
a
biotechnolog
compani
that
ha
to
decid
whether
to
put
itself
up
for
sale
enter
a
strateg
relationship
or
continu
to
go
it
alon
each
of
those
option
will
lead
on
to
other
valu
enhanc
or
valu
destroy
scenario
we
work
with
the
client
firstli
to
understand
and
challeng
the
assumpt
associ
with
their
most
like
busi
develop
scenario
and
secondli
to
help
them
identifi
decis
that
would
help
protect
or
increas
the
valu
of
their
technolog
or
compani
quantifi
technic
regulatori
or
commerci
risk
can
sometim
be
a
challeng
in
technolog
intens
field
howev
we
have
found
that
manag
often
scientist
are
quit
will
to
describ
the
main
sourc
of
risk
and
to
ass
the
probabl
that
a
riski
event
may
or
may
not
occur
how
doe
thi
kind
of
riski
decis
make
relat
to
real
option
valuat
you
can
t
say
what
the
valu
of
an
asset
is
until
you
decid
what
you
might
use
it
for
thi
mean
that
to
form
an
opinion
about
the
valu
of
an
asset
you
must
explor
the
most
import
decis
that
you
are
like
to
face
and
that
will
have
a
signific
impact
on
the
valu
of
the
asset
so
decis
analysi
help
to
defin
the
busi
problem
and
to
uncov
a
stream
of
inter
relat
choic
that
are
in
effect
real
option
for
exampl
if
a
compani
is
tri
to
decid
whether
to
invest
in
a
riski
project
doe
it
have
the
option
to
pull
the
plug
on
the
invest
at
an
earli
stage
if
a
pilot
project
give
a
poor
show
that
real
option
reduc
the
riski
and
increas
the
potenti
valu
of
the
origin
busi
plan
so
real
option
and
decis
analysi
are
realli
veri
close
to
one
anoth
but
you
don
t
have
to
believ
in
real
option
valuat
to
find
decis
analysi
use
what
do
you
mean
often
decis
analysi
can
help
manag
to
identifi
the
key
risk
in
a
strateg
decis
attach
weight
to
these
and
show
clearli
how
they
interact
for
mani
compani
thi
risk
discoveri
is
the
most
valuabl
part
of
the
exercis
real
option
theori
ha
been
criticis
recent
for
be
well
not
veri
realist
is
it
a
practic
approach
to
valuat
it
s
import
not
to
hold
out
unrealist
hope
for
the
real
option
approach
to
valuat
but
it
s
an
excit
methodolog
and
it
s
also
sometim
the
onli
reason
way
of
tackl
a
veri
practic
problem
for
exampl
when
a
firm
sell
an
asset
the
firm
might
have
to
make
an
independ
valuat
of
the
asset
for
legal
or
corpor
govern
reason
but
in
mani
busi
today
there
are
asset
that
simpli
can
not
be
valu
in
tradit
way
becaus
they
are
difficult
to
link
to
cashflow
the
cashflow
might
not
exist
becaus
the
busi
is
so
novel
or
they
might
be
hidden
in
some
respect
a
real
option
analysi
is
much
closer
to
realiti
than
a
tradit
valuat
how
exactli
the
classic
way
of
valu
a
futur
busi
is
to
base
the
calcul
on
a
singl
discount
cashflow
that
is
project
from
the
activ
but
thi
doesn
t
realli
take
account
of
the
way
that
scenario
can
chang
or
the
fact
that
manag
can
react
to
situat
a
they
unfold
i
mention
earlier
the
option
to
kill
a
project
or
busi
at
an
earli
point
but
the
upsid
is
that
if
a
pilot
project
yield
excit
result
it
might
allow
you
to
invest
more
quickli
and
reach
a
revenu
gener
posit
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
the
origin
busi
plan
allow
so
to
valu
a
futur
busi
we
realli
need
to
look
at
the
cashflow
that
might
aris
in
a
number
of
scenario
thi
is
realist
in
that
if
the
project
get
the
green
light
you
can
bet
that
it
manag
will
be
take
that
kind
of
decis
on
the
ground
all
of
the
time
what
s
the
most
challeng
part
of
map
out
a
decis
analysi
tree
model
the
link
between
the
variabl
in
the
decis
tree
it
s
someth
we
have
particular
strength
in
but
it
s
also
tricki
to
know
when
it
s
worthwhil
to
add
on
more
detail
and
when
it
s
better
to
draw
back
in
a
recent
erisk
interview
rick
buy
chief
risk
offic
of
enron
said
that
over
the
two
year
that
enron
had
experi
with
the
real
option
concept
it
had
found
it
of
limit
but
not
zero
use
whi
is
there
a
slight
air
of
cynic
about
real
option
in
some
busi
today
it
s
strang
that
enron
would
profess
thi
attitud
a
few
year
ago
it
wa
wide
report
to
have
use
real
option
valuat
to
support
a
veri
profit
purchas
decis
they
had
appar
bought
cheapli
some
older
gener
in
the
u
that
gener
electr
at
a
veri
high
cost
they
knew
that
they
could
mothbal
them
for
most
of
the
year
and
switch
them
on
onli
when
the
electr
price
were
suffici
high
nevertheless
from
a
custom
s
point
of
view
there
might
have
been
too
much
hype
about
the
methodolog
one
problem
in
the
applic
of
real
option
technolog
is
that
there
are
perhap
too
mani
peopl
tri
to
tweak
realiti
to
conform
to
their
perfect
model
it
s
better
to
aim
for
someth
pragmat
that
clearli
improv
decis
over
time
in
one
pharmaceut
compani
we
work
with
recent
we
work
togeth
to
improv
their
valuat
analysi
by
move
from
a
singl
discount
cash
flow
methodolog
to
one
that
took
into
account
a
rather
small
set
of
busi
scenario
it
would
have
shock
some
academ
and
consult
but
it
wa
an
undeni
improv
on
the
origin
approach
whi
do
you
think
financi
institut
are
onli
just
pick
up
on
your
field
when
it
s
been
appli
in
the
energi
industri
for
year
or
more
it
might
have
someth
to
do
with
the
rel
stabil
of
the
bank
world
until
recent
and
the
rel
high
margin
that
bank
line
have
enjoy
also
industri
such
a
energi
and
pharmaceut
tend
to
have
more
peopl
with
an
engin
and
scienc
background
the
dynam
model
of
decis
is
base
on
methodolog
origin
dream
up
to
help
engin
design
electr
and
electron
system
thi
approach
is
quit
distinct
from
the
black
schole
option
analysi
that
the
bank
world
is
familiar
with
the
black
schole
approach
is
difficult
to
appli
in
a
real
option
context
becaus
everyth
depend
on
the
assumpt
that
you
put
into
the
black
schole
model
the
real
option
approach
on
the
other
hand
is
in
a
sens
a
way
of
model
those
assumpt
more
explicitli
but
bank
are
now
adopt
some
of
the
think
particularli
in
term
of
use
decis
analysi
to
pinpoint
risk
and
identifi
valu
enhanc
decis
and
in
use
real
option
methodolog
to
sort
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
their
more
specul
invest
you
mean
their
internet
invest
we
have
recent
work
with
a
major
dutch
bank
that
had
arriv
late
in
the
internet
game
and
then
made
a
consider
number
of
invest
now
that
even
b
b
busi
model
have
question
mark
hang
over
them
and
mani
b
c
busi
are
alreadi
under
water
they
want
to
work
out
which
invest
might
contain
real
valu
in
thi
situat
it
s
a
case
of
rank
prioriti
and
help
the
bank
make
sens
of
what
could
turn
into
a
decis
make
chao
rather
than
sophist
valuat
it
s
not
just
a
case
of
whether
an
internet
invest
should
be
kill
off
but
the
problem
of
whether
continu
fund
for
it
should
take
prioriti
over
budget
demand
for
major
it
upgrad
in
exist
busi
and
so
on
these
are
veri
practic
question
and
they
have
to
be
answer
somehow
are
there
other
area
in
financi
institut
that
seem
access
to
thi
approach
ye
for
exampl
we
think
it
can
help
work
out
the
valu
associ
with
variou
approach
to
market
a
new
bank
busi
line
at
the
moment
mani
bank
are
chase
high
net
worth
individu
but
it
s
not
alway
clear
which
kind
of
individu
a
particular
bank
should
decid
to
pursu
the
bank
might
have
a
region
or
industri
advantag
alreadi
in
one
particular
area
for
exampl
music
busi
peopl
but
what
is
the
churn
rate
associ
with
thi
kind
of
custom
what
is
the
profit
associ
with
the
custom
segment
will
the
time
and
cost
benefit
of
the
advantag
the
bank
ha
in
the
sector
outweigh
ani
disadvantag
weigh
up
thi
kind
of
complex
problem
where
one
thing
lead
to
and
depend
on
anoth
is
what
decis
and
real
option
analysi
is
good
at
is
there
ani
way
of
rigor
backtest
or
valid
real
option
valuat
in
all
honesti
not
realli
the
problem
is
that
by
the
time
the
option
is
exercis
mani
of
the
variabl
surround
it
will
have
chang
so
it
s
difficult
to
compar
our
origin
analysi
with
how
thing
turn
out
howev
the
valu
of
the
analysi
come
not
onli
from
the
final
number
the
valu
of
thi
asset
is
x
but
also
from
provid
a
thorough
process
an
outsid
s
point
of
view
an
understand
of
the
sourc
of
valu
and
in
short
a
bit
of
clearer
think
if
real

are
so
import
whi
are
they
so
rare
cite
in

the
battl
is
still
to
convinc
compani
to

even
in
major
compani
in
the
oil
ga
and
pharmaceut

where
the
idea
have
taken
some
root
intern
there
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
reluct
to
use
them
in

commun
we
are
work
with
analyst
to
understand
better
what
they
need
to
if
we
are
