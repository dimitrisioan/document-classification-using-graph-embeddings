some

a
you
know
i
had
invit
one
financ
professor
to
our

on
arundel
but
he
wa
out
of

i
do
plan
to
invit
sheridan
titman
to
discus
the
issu
of
use
the
option
model
in
situat
where
there
is
no
underli
secur
that
is
trade
i
do
think
it
is
import
to
face
that
issu
which
is
actual
cover
at
a
theoret
level
in
our
last
coupl
of
read
the
issu
of
volatil
is
also
an
excel
issu
for
further
discus
a
you
suggest
so
far
we
ve
been
look
at
case
where
volatil
is
given
the
problem
of
find
an
object
measur
of
volatil
for
a
project
remind
me
of
the
problem
of
find
the
correct
risk
adjust
discount
rate
which
is
not
surpris
sinc
the
concept
are
almost
two
side
of
the
same
plate
one
approach
of
cours
is
to
do
some
model
use
tradit
decis

tool
includ
subject
probabl
but
the
financ
peopl
who
write
option
articl
don
t
like
to
think
about
such
idea
i
ll
tri
to
address
these
issu
in
more
detail
a
the
semest
continu
i
think
it
wa
import
to
surfac
some
of
these
point
earli
and
to
come
back
to
them
after
we
have
seen
how

you

i
also
realiz
that

real

applic

degener

a
success
of
assumpt
that
result
in
a

my
opinion
at
thi
point
is
that
two
issu
are
of
potenti
make
or
brake
import
if
i
am
to
persuad
my
superior
to
accept
these
method
for

outsid
the
realm
of

whose
valu
is
primarili
driven
by
the
valu
of
commod
back
by

these
issu
are
easi
to
guess
discount
and
risk
free

i
do
not

that
anyon

in

there
someon
within

can
present
a

question
volatil
i
found
winston

succinct
i
would

that
in

you
