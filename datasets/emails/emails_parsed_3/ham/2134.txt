we
are

if
so

should
we
use

first
some
addit

possibl

still
be

below
the
upcom

price
either
price
in

or
turkish

we
current
hold
the
abov
number
of
option
with
a

price
of

but
expir
on
juli
with
the
remaind
expir
on
decemb
the
compani
s
invest
banker
abn
amro
rothchild
are
concern
regard
the
strike
price
becaus
it
valu
the
compani
at
million
and
they
believ
the
compani
is
worth
approx
million
due
to
such
a
larg
valuat
gap
they
origin
encourag
u
to
exercis
all
of
the
option
by
the
end
of
june
ipo
target
date
in
late
sept
earli
oct
our
counter
propos
is
to
swap
instrins
valu
for
time
valu
by
repric
the
option
strike
higher
while
extend
their
term
we
are
current
negoti
with
rac
the
most
appropri
discount
rate
to
use
to
valu
the
option
we
are
argu
that
the
u
risk
free
is
the
most
appropri
discount
rate
and
their
current
posit
is
that
the
compani
s
histor
senior
debt
cost
is
the
more
appropri
number
to
use
although
admit
that
thi
is
not
justifi
onli
a
proxi
a
few
key
point
rac
is
valu
the
option
via
crystal
ball
simul
such
that
thi
to
be
negoti
discount
rate
is
use
to
calcul
the
pv
of
the
futur
option
intrins
valu
in
year
i
e
for
black
schole
a
higher
discount
rate
yield
a
higher
valu
but
the
opposit
is
true
use
crystal
ball
simul
the
model
simul
both
an
ipo
no
ipo
case
and
in
the
case
of
no
ipo
we
have
put
option
for
our
equiti
price
at
a
fix
return
the
model
assign
a
illiquid
discount
in
the
simul
case
where
the
option
are
out
of
the
money
we
obvious
do
not
exercis
we
understand
that
for
black
schole
option
valuat
one
need
to
be
abl
to
construct
a
compar
portfolio
of
cash
flow
use
equiti
futur
and
the
risk
free
in
order
for
the
valuat
to
hold
and
here
is
where
we
reach
our
difficulti
sinc
the
compani
doesn
t
current
trade
on
a
public
market
and
sinc
equiti
futur
do
not
exist
for
turkish
equiti
rac
is
argu
that
a
u
risk
free
is
not
appropri
to
use
our
argument
is
that
the
non
ipo
scenario
a
illiquid
discount
and
a
u
base
option
volatil
are
alreadi
in
the
factor
into
the
simul
a
such
we
feel
rac
s
approach
is
doubl
count
if
you
manag
to
get
through
the
abov
your
a
patient
man
i
ll
give
you
a
call
today
or

after
