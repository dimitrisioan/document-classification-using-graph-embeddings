it

obviou
that
there

but
it
is
import
to
note
that
the
pro

entiti
are
more

in

while
the
anti

entiti
are

we
have
document
the
frequenc
and
durat
data
by

with
the
thought
that
the
anti

entiti
would
be
interest
in

product
and
the
pro

entiti
would
like
be
more

depend
on

we
have
collect

it
ha
confirm
our
expect
that

is
quit

and
unpredict
it
is
believ
that
thi

when

would

the

in

case
busi
may

certainli
probabl
felt
a
if
thi
wa
a
risk
they
would
have
to
wear
themselv
a
we
move
forward
on

the

will
certainli
need

such

addit
we
need

back

so
long
a

doesn

declin
on

market
front
i
am
certainli
open
to
idea
it
is
believ
the
weather
channel
would
be
the
most
natur
parti
for
such
a
product
given
our
posit
relationship
that
we
current
have
with
them
they
might
be
the
easiest
sell
ani
and
all
idea
are
welcom
with

when
we

pleas
