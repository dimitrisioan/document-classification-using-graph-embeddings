have
been
focus
on
for
the
california
electr
crisi
state
offici
around
governor
gray
davi
have
toughen
up
their
rhetor
on
a
coupl
of
front
even
a
they
confirm
they
would
be
in
the
market
a
earli
a
tuesday
take
bid
for
energi
to
be
paid
by
the
state
of
california
one
problem
on
that
front
is
still
how
much
produc
want
to
charg
the
state
for
electr
a
we
report
last
week
davi
and
hi
aid
want
to
pay
around
to
dollar
per
megawatt
hour
and
supplier
want
about
treasuri
secretari
summer
ha
suggest
an
auction
a
the
best
way
to
determin
the
price
but
california
offici
are
take
a
le
free
market
approach
and
still
hope
to
set
the
price
through
negoti
over
long
term
contract
our
sourc
in
washington
sacramento
and
california
are
increasingli
of
the
view
that
governor
davi
is
posit
hi
govern
to
establish
long
term
power
contract
with
the
gener
that
could
be
pass
through
to
the
util
follow
a
bankruptci
in
the
near
term
thi
week
s
legisl
activ
in
sacramento
will
creat
the
vehicl
to
do
so
state
credit
back
purchas
of
power
would
obviat
the
need
for
super
prioriti
borrow
to
financ
power
purchas
after
util
bankruptci
audit
untangl
util
relationship
california
offici
have
also
toughen
their
rhetor
on
the
debt
repay
front
a
they
say
result
from
a
preliminari
audit
show
that
half
of
the
to
billion
the
util
say
they
owe
is
actual
owe
to
themselv
for
power
they
bought
from
their
corpor
relat
thi
strang
situat
is
due
to
the
fact
that
one
hold
compani
own
both
the
power
gener
and
power
distribut
compani
under
a
hold
compani
umbrella
of
cours
that
mean
that
some
of
the
power
pg
e
and
southern
california
edison
bought
at
highli
inflat
price
wa
bought
from
themselv
but
it
wa
not
all
bad
news
in
the
tens
negoti
sourc
confirm
that
davi
increasingli
understood
that
the
state
financ
role
wa
a
crucial
part
of
ani
potenti
solut
he
told
our
sourc
thi
afternoon
that
he
is
will
to
use
state
credit
to
elimin
the
riski
debt
premium
that
pg
e
and
sce
are
be
charg
by
supplier
becaus
of
their
shaki
financ
and
that
he
is
will
to
extend
the
current
rate
increas
util
custom
are
pay
far
beyond
the
initi
day
deadlin
in
return
he
is
demand
that
the
compani
prepar
to
share
the
burden
of
debt
reduct
in
return
for
state
help
and
credit
extens
debt
restructur
guarante
but
no
direct
state
money
davi
also
told
the
videoconfer
that
he
belief
the
billion
in
back
debt
owe
by
the
util
compani
can
be
clear
up
dure
a
day
forbear
period
whether
that
period
ha
been
agre
to
by
all
creditor
is
not
someth
we
are
clear
about
right
now
davi
idea
a
he
laid
it
out
in
the
meet
is
to
use
the
forbear
period
to
securit
the
debt
and
sell
them
against
the
util
forward
rate
base
or
by
establish
a
medium
term
repay
plan
back
by
continu
state
guarante
in
both
case
the
restructur
debt
would
be
resolv
over
a
decad
without
direct
use
of
taxpay
money
a
the
util
use
their
posit
margin
to
paydown
their
debt
one
of
the
reason
davi
want
to
stay
close
to
the
megawatt
charg
is
that
it
maxim
the
rate
at
which
util
can
pay
down
thi
debt
there
is
a
strong
chanc
that
davi
will
agre
to
use
state
guarante
to
sweeten
the
pot
at
the
end
of
these
negoti
but
he
remain
oppos
to
use
direct
state
money
thi
frustrat
both
clinton
administr
and
util
creditor
but
davi
ha
not
yet
shown
much
flexibl
emin
domain
reregul
perhap
most
frustrat
to
the
washington
dc
free

crowd
at
treasuri
and
the
white

wa
the
continu
comfort
davi
and
hi
group
of
polit
advis
have
with
non
market
solut
to
the
energi
crisi
although
the
governor
s
aid
actual
believ
the
weapon
is
more
a
way
to
forc
eventu
agreement
than
an
actual
solut
the

frequent
to

we
have
the
ultim

by

deadlin
if
we
make
no

if
thi
thing
look

it

turn

then
we
will
