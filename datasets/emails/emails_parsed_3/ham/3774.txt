meet
steve
i
ll
see
if
i
can
get
in
on
the
th
will
let
you
know
but
i
think
it
ll
work
just
to
give
you
a
veri
brief
overview
so
you
can
think
about
who
might
be
interest
abacu
ha
the
largest
transact
databas
of
consum
buy
behavior
in
the
world
million
u
household
billion
purchas
along
with
sophist
model
capabl
to
help
predict
custom
respons
to
variou
offer
at
the
household
level
given
the
critic
need
to
reduc
custom
acquisit
cost
in
retail
energi
market
we
believ
that
our
data
and
model
can
help
energi
retail
target
their
direct
market
effort
toward
the
residenti
custom
most
like
to
respond
to
whatev
the
offer
is
improv
the
effici
of
mail
and
other
promot
campaign
so
there
is
an
effici
angl
see
becaus
our
data
allow
the
model
of
futur
buy
behavior
base
on
actual
purchas
our
result
tend
to
be
significantli
more
predict
than
demograph
base
model
so
far
the
the
respons
from
util
and
new
entrant
i
ve
been
talk
to
so
far
ha
been
quit
posit
and
we
have
some
test
of
our
data
underway
but
we
re
interest
in
talk
to
a
mani
player
in
the
market
a
possibl
a
we
develop
specif
product
to
meet
util
need
i
can
provid
more
background
if
desir
to
whoever
might
be
interest
but
i
guess
the
key
immedi
question
is
whether
it
might
be
worthwhil
to
arrang
a
short
meet
sometim
on
the
th
of
april
with
whoever
at
enron
might
have
interest
in
hear
what
we
re
up
to
and
most
importantli
listen
to
what
your

need
might
be
a

much
