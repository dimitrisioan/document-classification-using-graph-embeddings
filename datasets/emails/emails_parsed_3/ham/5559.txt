chonawe
short
sell
is
better
than
exercis
your
employe
stock
option
in
gener
the
sensibl
time
to
exercis
your
employe
stock
option
is
when
you
specul
that
ene
is
go
down
or
it
growth
rate
is
extrem
low
in
fact
when
exercis
the
option
you
are
specul
that
ene

never
reach
thi
point
plu
interest
again
dure
the
year
matur
date
or
until
you
leav
the
compani
if
you
do
not
anticip
that
you
should
hold
on
to
your
option
becaus
you
can
gain
higher
profit
by
delay
your
exercis
howev
if
you
believ
that
ene
is
reach
it
peak
then
instead
of
exercis
the
option
you
should
short
sell
or
sell
the
stock
in
that
amount
after
short
sell
when
you
feel
that
the
stock
start
to
go
up
you
can
buy
them
back
to
cover
make
profit
and
still
keep
the
option
on
the
other
hand
if
