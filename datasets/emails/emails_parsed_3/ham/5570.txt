some
comment

success
market
order
but
not
after
limit
order
you
may
want
it
after
limit
order
a
well
to
be
consist
i
am
not
clear
on
how
you
would
use
enron
posit
it
is
possibl
that
the
trade
desk
will
have
a
target
posit
in
mind
and
they
will
set
bid
and
offer
in
such
a
way
a
to
tri
to
achiev
that
target
posit
but
thi
target
posit
probabl
chang
continu
and
is
not
store
anywher
and
without
thi
target
posit
there
is
noth
to
compar
actual
enron
posit
to
of
cours
enron
posit
may
still
provid
some
insight
you
request
bid
mid
ask
price
for
each
trade
given
that
a
success
trade
may
execut
later

rang
of
bid
mid
ask
over
thi
time
interv
time
of
order
to
time
of
execut
also
for
fail
trade

evolut
or
rang
of
bid
mid
ask
over
the
time
interv
from
time
of
order
to
time
of
reject
thi
again
mainli
appli
to
