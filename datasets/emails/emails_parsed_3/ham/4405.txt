jcc
good
morn
i
apolog
for
the
respons
delay
i
ve
gone
back
through
the
analysi
that
i
did
back
in
april
and
have
thrown
around
some
idea
with
vinc
and
stinson
the
issu
may
be
summar
a
follow
the
hedg
relationship
wa
deriv
use
jcc
and
prompt
brent
and
is
valid
for
jcc
and
prompt
brent
no
problem
here
howev
it
will
not
be
valid
for
point
far
out
on
the
forward
curv
intuit
thi
hedg
relationship
will
approach
one
a
we
move
far
out
on
the
curv
but
sinc
there
is
no
data
i
can
not
statist
determin
thi
one
can
imagin
a
term
structur
of
hede
ratio
that
start
at
and
move
to
so
that
the
back
end
of
the
curv
would
move
togeth
but
how
fast
it
converg
to
one
is
anyon
s
guess
if
there
is
a
way
of
determin
the
histor
jcc
forward
curv
then
the
hedg
relationship
may
be
estim
howev
i
have
been
unabl
to
determin
a
rigor
approach
to
build
the
jcc
curv
i
can
explain
thi
far
better
in
person
and
would
like
to
talk
a
soon
a
possibl
at
your
conveni
