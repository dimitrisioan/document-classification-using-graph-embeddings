non
firm
power
curv
build
hi
vinc
amitava
and
i
have
receiv
a
request
to
build
a
non
firm
power
curv
for
each
region
from
david
hoog
s
doubl
trigger
folk
the
object
a
they
explain
it
is
to
allow
the
desk
to
buy
non
firm
from
the
market
buy
david
s
outag
product
and
sell
firm
to
the
market
account
would
like
a
curv
to
mark
the
non
firm
posit
my
initi
thought
is
that
the
desk
should
provid
thi
non
firm
curv
but
it
seem
that
thi
market
is
veri
illiquid
and
they
are
reluct
so
they
have
put
the
ball
in
david
hoog
s
court
to
build
the
curv
if
david
want
to
sell
hi
product
intern
to
the
desk
assum
we
build
the
curv
the
next
issu
is
how
to
defin
non
firm
the
onli
way
i
can
think
of
is
to
tie
the
non
firm
to
a
specif
gener
unit
or
group
of
unit
thi
will
allow
the
purchas
of
david
s
outag
product
to
cover
the
non
firm
risk
tie
the
definit
of
non
firm
to
a
whole
region
seem
implaus
what
doe
it
mean
to
give
a
market
the
option
to
not
deliv
power
if
there
is
ani
problem
anywher
in
the
region
consequ
the
non
firm
curv
take
on
a
unit
level
interpret
and
not
a
region
level
interpret
consequ
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
talk
about
the
non
firm
curv
for
the
region
we
will
need
to
build
a
non
firm
curv
for
each
gener
unit
or
group
of
unit
mayb
i
could
get
your
thought
later
today
thank
vasant
