i
have
written
to
pal
quilkey
to
invit
christian
werner
to
houston
for
a
week
to
discus
how
much
of
hi
research
we
can
use

i
have
inquir
into
christian
s
climat
model
it
seem
to
me
like
a
long
term
project
chiristian
say
that
hi
model
might
be
abl
to
do
better
than
the
australian
met
given
that
they
ignor
some
of
the
variabl
he
use
and
that
they
are
an
old
boy
s
network
resist
to
new
develop
but
i
don
t
think
the
same
can
be
said
of
most
other
weather
servic
a
far
a
the
nw
goe
they
run
their
model
on
a
cray
they
have
sever
veri
talent
phd
s
work
on
it
full
time
and
even
then
they
can
onli
get
a
dozen
or
so
run
per
night
in
other
word
it
s
a
huge
system
replic
someth
even
close
to
that
will
not
be
an
easi
task
that
be
said
i
think
there
are
relat
applic
that
we
could
look
into
sinc
i
ve
alreadi
promis
the
rac
group
and
the
weather
desk
s
pjm
trader
to
put
togeth
a
vector
autoregress
model
of
daili
temperatur
i
think
it
make
sen
to
see
if
someth
better
than
a
var
model
can
be
put
togeth
perhap
a
veri
strip
down
version
of
the
kind
of
model
christian
ha
what
i
have
in
mind
is
someth
that
would
give
u
say
up
to
sever
dozen
of
possibl
temperatur
forecast
everi
morn
which
would
be
calcul
use
actual
climat
model
a
oppos
to
time
seri
model
i
would
not
use
thi
a
a
forecast
tool
the
nw
model
result
would
make
a
far
better
best
guess
but
our
ensembl
could
still
be
use
to
provid
a
distribut
of
temperatur
scenario
thi
ensembl
would
have
sever
use
we
could
price
the
book
for
the
ensembl
of
run
and
therebi
obtain
a
more
realist
daili
v
r
for
the
weather
book
and
eventu
interfac
that
with
the
power
desk
s
v
r
calcul
we
could
use
the
ensembl
of
forecast
to
relat
temperatur
forecast
to
week
ahead
cdd
and
hdd
distribut
for
use
in
our
demand
swap
if
free
noti
were
to
give
u
one
of
their
qualit
forecast
e
g
expect
the
trough
to
reced
we
could
sort
through
the
differ
mont
carlo
scenarion
find
one
in
which
the
trough
in
question
is
reced
and
use
correspond
output
statist
to
download
the
actual
temperatur
correspond
to
that
scenario
up
till
now
we
haven
t
found
a
good
way
of
get
a
numer
fix
on
what
differ
forecast
actual
mean
temperatur
wise
we
could
use
the
associ
visual
routin
that
come
with
such
model
to
get
anim
of
the
evolut
of
histor
weather
pattern
the
trader
could
use
these
in
order
to
look
for
histor
period
which
roughli
match
current
weather
condit
and
get
an
idea
of
what
could
happen
although
these
meteorolog
model
would
not
be
good
for
simul
month
ahead
or
season
ahead
weather
trust
me
on
thi
we
could
still
use
the
visual
technolog
to
do
to
analog
season
anim
just
today
i
ve
spoken
with
dr
jacobsen
of
stanford
univers
who
ha
written
one
of
the
more
recent
textbook
on
climat
forecast
and
who
work
with
ucla
s
gener
circul
model
he
say
that
get
a
simplifi
version
of
mm
which
is
itself
a
simplifi
limit
area
version
of
the
gcm
model
that
nw
cola
and
ucla
use
would
take
sever
month
to
implement
assum
the
peopl
involv
are
alreadi
well
vers
in
the
technolog
also
i
have
contact
aer
a
massachusett
base
weather
consult
firm
and
they
tell
me
that
they
have
a
mm
model
run
daili
onli
one
run
per
night
and
also
some
smaller
pc
model
up
and
run
they
are
of
cours
will
to
work
with
u
for
a
fee
their
mm
version
run
on
a
parallel
processor
i
am
open
to
your
suggest
or
object
a
the
case
may
be
i
m
not
sure
how
the
cost
would
be
apport
given
that
thi
would
benefit
all
of
enron
and
not
just
the
weather
desk
i
am
schedul
to
go
to
boston
next
week
anyway
and
would
like
to
use
the
opportun
to
visit
with
aer
i
will
of
cours
coordin
ani
project
with
christian
if
we
get
someth
like
thi
up
and
run
it
will
be
more
like
that
he
can
get
the
comput
power
he
need
to
run
