wa
ask
if
it
is
appropri
to
use
a
set
of
factor
correspond
to
some
commod
for
anoth
commod
thi
map
we
do
quit
frequent
in
our
var
system
when
forward
price
for
a
commod
are
not
correl
becaus
of
poor
price
histori
i
think
use
thi
kind
of
map
is
ok
becaus
we
can
not
trust
these
correl
base
on
illiquid
price
inform
if
we
believ
the
matrix
with
low
correl
repres
what
goe
on
in
the
market
and
we
simpli
can
not
reconstruct
it
with
our
factor
then
we
might
use
more
factor
then
or
the
matrix
itself

you
also
rise
a

question
if

should
we

the

statist
analysi
on

it
would

the

a

good

i
understand
thi

difficult
