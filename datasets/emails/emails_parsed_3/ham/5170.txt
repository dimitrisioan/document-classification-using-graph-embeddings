have
attach
a
zip

the
total

the
cu
posit

i
have
had
troubl
get
hold
of
you
so
i
thought
i
would
summaris
what
i
want
to

about
also
i
thought
i
would
give
your
ear
a
rest
basic
it
is
wrt
the
second
point
in
your
mail
yesterday
we
briefli
discuss
it
earlier
the
fax
you
sent
me
to
explain
the
risk
calcul
suggest
that
you
use
a
day
period
of
adjust
to
calcul
the
risk
in
thi
case
it
is
call
capit
at
risk
the
var
calcul
for
our
model
is
for
a
one
day
hold
period
which
mean
that
your
risk
factor
will
be
reduc
by
a
factor
equal
the
sqrt
or
sinc
old
risk
factor
std
of
the
price
movement
new
daili
risk
factor
which
actual
equat
to
std
of
approx
a
day
i
am
happi
with
thi
a
a
estim
of
the
vol
a
the
annual
spot
vol
we
are
show
for
cu
is
approx
which
equat
to
approx
daili
use
thi
new
risk
factor
for
the
daili
var
the
cu
posit
would
give
a
var
for
the
th
of
approx
m
which
is
le
that
the
figur
we
estim
the
other
thing
is
that
by
take
net
number
we
are
disregard
the
term
structur
of
the
price
curv
vol
curv
and
posit
curv
and
are
henc
collaps
everyth
into
a
one
factor
model
which
mean
that
it
is
difficult
to
compar
the
number
i
hope
that
thi
help
to
explain
our
number
hope
we
can
talk
tomorrow
