i
receiv
a
letter
from
an

i
respect
chide
me
for
my
naderit
column
on
the
california
energi
crisi
he
just
didn

believ
that

manipul
by
power
compani
could
possibl
be
an

issu
it
sound
too
much
to
him
like
the
sort
of
thing
one
hear
from

leftist
who
blame
greedi

for
everi
problem
be

third

rent
the

ha
cri
wolf
so
mani
time
that
sensibl
peopl
have
learn
to
discount
such
claim
but
now
a
bona
fide
wolf
ha
arriv
whose
predatori
behavior
is
do
terribl
damag
to
our
most
popul
state

and
nobodi
will
believ
it
true
california
would
be
head
for
a
summer
of
power
shortag
even
if
it
had
never
deregul
and
even
if
there
wa
workabl
competit
in

price
in

market
would
spike
dure
period
of
peak
demand
transfer
billion
of
dollar
from
either
taxpay

consum
to
the
gener
but
the
evid
is
now
overwhelm
that
there
isn
t
workabl
competit
in
california
s
power
market
and
that
the
action
of
gener
game
the
system
have
greatli
magnifi
the

the
key
fact
is
that
california
ha
somehow
remain
in
a
state
of
more
or
le
continu
power
shortag
and
veri
high
wholesal
price
regardless
of
the
level
of

a
rash
of

ha
kept

short
of

can
t
tell
directli
whether
he
is
realli
sick
or
ha
chosen
to
take
the
day
off
for

reason
but
you
can
look
for
circumstanti
evid
and
such
evid
ha
convinc
mr

that

use
forc
outag
strateg
to
withhold

ha
been
sympathet
to
call

ignor
the
fact
that
electr

have
stay
at
hard
to
explain
level
even
when
there
is
no
emerg
in
effect
the
plan
is
laid
out
a
if
the
electr

were
realli
competit
in
spite
of
all
the
evid
that
it
is
not

even
those

the

seem
