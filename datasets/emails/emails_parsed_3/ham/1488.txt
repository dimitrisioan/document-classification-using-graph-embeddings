i
shall
read

my
comment
without

i
think

the
decis
to

a

remov
one
signific
risk
we
have
at
the
elba
island
project
plea
see
point

brad
hitch
scott
earnest
salli
beck
s
organ
and
rac
to
set
up
the
book
for
the
elba
island
transact
the
next
step
will
be
to
expand
the
book
to
captur
all
the
enron
s
lng
relat
posit
in
one
place
and
to
look
for
natur
risk
offset
and
possibl
hedg
a
work
group
is
meet
to
close
a
few
remain
gap
tomorrow
tuesday
at
a
few
comment
on
the
book
design
and
my
view
of
the
project
a
the
current
think
is
that
lng
will
be
sourc
for
the
elba
island
facil
by
buy
margin
cargo
on
the
fob
basi
margin
cargo
will
repres
suppli
from
excess
capac
that
ha
not
been
commit
under
long
term
contract
or
becam
avail
due
to
some
short
term
friction
the
fob
cargo
are
typic
sell
at
a
signific
discount
to
the
long
term
contract
price
the
econom
of
the
deal
a
repres
by
the
book
we
are
set
up
will
reflect
the
assumpt
that
not
onli
we
can
locat
margin
cargo
but
that
we
shall
be
abl
to
do
it
on
a
regular
basi
arrang
ship
and
coordin
the
facil
schedul
and
natur
ga
transact
in
the
u
in
other
word
we
have
a
signific
logist
and
oper
risk
in
thi
transact
b
the
transact
will
cover
the
period
of
year
with
an
extens
option
of
year
even
if
we
can
lock
in
the
lng
volum
over
thi
time
period
we
have
no
abil
to
lock
in
the
other
side
of
the
spread
u
ga
price
for
such
a
long
tenor
thi
is
essenti
a
toll
transact
with
exposur
to
the
lng
nat
ga
spread
and
i
would
not
recommend
lock
in
onli
one
leg
of
the
spread
one
solut
would
be
to
cover
let
s
say
of
he
lng
volum
for
the
first
year
and
lock
in
the
nat
ga
side
on
the
u
market
side
c
the

we
are
set
up
will
be
base
on
mani
manageri
assumpt
regard
sourc
of

i
would
set
up
a
