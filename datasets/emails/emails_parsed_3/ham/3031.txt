think
it
would
be
use
to
verifi
their

realli
onli
year
from

product
ideal
we
could
get
that
confirm
from
someon
familiar
with
the
technolog
but
without
ani
financi
interest
in
it
success
their
technolog
pitch
sound
good
but
i
don
t
know
enough
to
recogn
the
potenti
shortcom
i
want
to
feel
comfort
that
you
all
feel
thi
is
real
then
i
would
be
happi
to
have
me
and
my
