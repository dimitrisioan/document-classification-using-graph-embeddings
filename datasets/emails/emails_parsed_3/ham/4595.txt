rakesh
thank
for
your
input
they
are
quit
use
for
help
me
clarifi
my
own
think
the
follow
are
my
respons
to
your
comment
and
clarif
the
ed
paragraph
are
from
me
and
the
other
are
from
you
the
money
is
be
set
asid
to
avoid
neg
valu
it
is
not
clear
if
you
mean
the
valu
of
the
cash
flow
or
the
pv
at
the
node
anyhow
we
shall
be
set
asid
money
not
just
for
that
specif
node
but
all
node
at
that
cross
section
of
time
a
the
risk
free
asset
pay
in
all
state
of
natur
thi
will
have
to
be
done
everi
time
there
is
a
neg
realiz
thu
for
the
typic
project
we
have
the
valu
of
risk
capit
may
be
extrem
high
a
we
are
not
follow
a
tail
base
norm
anymor
i
agre
that
thi
is
confus
and
need
further
refin
i
do
thi
becaus
i
have
some
concern
about
discount
neg
cash
flow
thi
is
discus
in
my
first
memo
thi
clearli
provid
a
conserv
estim
of
firm
valu
and
a
measur
of
risk
capit
that
is
too
high
from
the
perspect
of
evalu
the
appropri
level
of
risk
capit
it
is
suffici
that
enough
capit
be
employ
so
that
the
pv
at
each
node
is
posit
also
one
might
want
to
set
the
level
so
that
the
pv
is
posit
in
say
of
all
node
your
memo
appear
to
suggest
that
debt
capac
is
conting
on
all
valu
be
posit
if
so
we
are
onli
issu
risk
free
debt
also
a
project
with
a
singl
neg
valu
at
each
cross
section
of
time
will
not
have
a
posit
debt
capac
again
thi
is
a
veri
conserv
initi
estim
when
the
model
is
refin
you
probabl
want
to
defin
debt
capac
so
that
the
project
default
a
certain
percent
of
the
time
it
seem
that
our
optim
argument
is
the
discount
rate
which
is
obtain
in
each
step
from
the
comparison
invest
by
equat
the
varianc
it
is
not
clear
if
chang
the
discount
rate
will
have
such
an
effect
on
the
project
varianc
so
a
to
lead
to
a
global
converg
i
am
not
assum
that
the
chang
in
the
discount
rate
ha
a
major
effect
on
volatil
in
fact
i
think
the
process
requir
onli
one
iter
when
the
volatil
is
independ
of
the
discount
rate
again
the
idea
is
that
we
calcul
the
volatil
of
the
project
s
valu
calcul
with
an
initi
discount
rate
use
the
calcul
volatil
and
the
stock
of
a
comparison
firm
calcul
a
more
appropri
discount
rate
if
the
volatil
of
the
project
s
valu
is
not
affect
by
the
chang
in
discount
rate
then
we
are
done
if
howev
the
chang
in
discount
rate
chang
volatil
then
we
may
have
to
iter
let
me
know
if
thi
make
sen
also
our
project
ha
a
finit
life
and
the
market
base
asset
will
have
infinit
live
in
the
light
of
thi
fact
how
will
we
defin
the
relev
varianc
is
it
the
spot
varianc
of
the
return
of
the
comparison
invest
thi
is
a
good
point
i
wa
think
in
term
of
the
averag
varianc
but
thi
may
not
be
correct
actual
we
know
that
thi
is
just
an
approxim
and
we
need
to
think
about
whether
or
not
it
is
a
good
approxim
typic
firm
tend
to
ignor
issu
relat
to
the
durat
of
their
project
cash
flow
when
they
determin
discount
rate
which
clearli
doe
not
make
sen
thi
requir
some
addit
thought
final
our
criterion
is
to
subtract
from
the
averag
pv
the
invest
and
also
the
risk
capit
set
risk
capit
to
zero
thi
model
close
resembl
the
intuit
present
valu
criterion
and
endogen
determin
the
discount
rate
thi
is
correct
my
goal
wa
to
come
up
with
someth
that
wa
close
relat
to
what
you
are
alreadi
do
but
which
give
you
some
insight
into
how
to
defin
risk
capit
and
the
appropri
discount
rate
there
are
a
number
of
way
that
we
can
refin
and
improv
thi
procedur
what
we
need
to
first
consid
is
whether
or
not
the
basic
approach
make
sen
for
the
kind
of
project
that
you
are
evalu

to

we
invest

and
varianc
of
the
product
per

is
avail
from
the

at
the

product
will
be
autocorrel
a
the

will
shift
up

be

it
might

to

about

to

thi
problem
is

it
is

that

onc
the

there
is
no

the

we

a

mlp
the

return
of

would
then
be
