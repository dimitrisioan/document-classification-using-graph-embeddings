hi
vinc
nelson
and
i
had
a
meet
yesterday
with
the
ag
desk
folk
on
how
to
go
forward
on
the
analysi
and
present
for
thi
program
the
consensu
from
the
ag
side
wa
that
the
choic
of
univers
will
be
highli
polit
driven
ie
prefer
the
univers
should
be
from
a
state
that
ha
close
tie
to
sympathet
senat
or
other
polit
figur
also
it
is
prefer
if
the
univers
faculti
have
work
on
ag
issu
befor
lend
more
credibl
in
the
ag
commun
the
name
that
came
up
were

a
m
nelson
know
of
a
person
at
mississippi
state
who
work
with
the
usda
on
risk
manag
issu
the
need
analysi
itself
is
not
necessarili
veri
deep
and
the
focu
is
primarili
to
get
a
non
quantit
present
out
that
outlin
how
enron
can
take
on
the
downsid
risk
of
local
crop
price
enron
probabl
need
to
cover
actual
local
price
and
not
simpli
an
index
becaus
i
do
not
think
the
govt
will
want
to
worri
about
basi
risk
the
pilot
program
itself
will
be
veri
small
and
lend
itself
to
continu
down
the
path
of
short
term
trade
rather
than
long
term
origin
anoth
thought
on
hedg
our
potenti
short
positon
on
the
origin
side
is
that
the
govt
program
can
onli
provid
a
partial
hedg
to
the
extent
of
the
premium
receiv
we
still
have
unlimit
