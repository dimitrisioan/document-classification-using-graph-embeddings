howev
at

he
is
await
my

note
a
a
quick
question
do

worth
includ
zinc
concentr
dmt
and
lead
concentr
dmt
i
think
we
may
need
to
check
the
tc
price
for
these
and
the
convers
for
the
one
given
in
the
model
for
copper
a
i
think
that
the
origin
histor
price
file
tchistori
is
quot
in
c
lb
i
guess
thi
is
cent
pound
rather
than
dmt
which
is
the
unit
that
posit
is
quot
in
speak
to
you
soon
