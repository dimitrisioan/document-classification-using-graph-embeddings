re
dear
navroz
thank
for
get
back
to
me
the
reason
there
ha
been
a
dialogu
not
i
should
point
out
with
nick
but
with
shan
milli
is
that
my
work
is
of
quit
a
larg
size
and
need
to
find
an
appropri
home
the
question
is
should
it
go
into
a
compil
book
or
somehow
be
publish
in
the
magazin
i
wa
await
some
feedback
from
risk
on
the
best
cours
of
action
we
were
hope
to
publish
a
cut
down
version
in
the
magazin
and
a
full
version
in
risk
s
upcom
game
choic
book
but
i
ve
heard
noth
from
your
organis
until
now
and
i
fear
we
ve
now
miss
the
boat
on
the
game
choic
book
deadlin
i
m
attach
the
full
intern
enron
document
for
your
refer
and
i
d
appreci
your
thought
on
how
best
to
put
the
articl
in
your
journal
sinc
the
subject
is
highli
diagrammat
i
m
concern
that
word
may
be
too
mani
when
coupl
with
diagram
it
is
current
onli
word
but
is
around
a
page
long
if
you
can
give
me
some
guidanc
on
the
issu
of
publish
extens
diagram
a
part
of
the
text
i
ll
get
to
work
chop
my
work
around
until
it
suit
your
prefer
format
shan
milli
gave
me
some
good
feedback
on
gener
point
of
style
and
clariti
in
my
write
but
incorpor
these
would
actual
make
the
articl
longer
rather
than
shorter
i
think
you

the
document
over
befor
i
do
further
work
on
