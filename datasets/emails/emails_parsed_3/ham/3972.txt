the
threat
of

is
still
veri
real
for

senior
advisor
said
that
these
util
were
on
the
path
often
follow
by
util
compani
that
end
in

a
all
the

down
for
anoth
intens
polit
week
they
all
remain
determin
to
avoid
bankruptci
but
to
push
thi
a
close
to
the
brink
a
possibl
in
the
hope
of
squeez
out
an
advantag
under
such
condit
the
risk
of
one
or
more
of
the
player
fumbl
and
trigger
the
great
unknow
outcom
of
bankruptci
is
still
quit
high
california
s
polit
leader
order
a
seri
of
independ
analysi
to
determin
who
would
suffer
most
in
a
case
of
bankruptci
the
state
or
the
two
util
the
short
answer
wa
that
no
one
ha
ani
idea
below
are
the
find
of
the
report
and
some
of
the
possibl
scenario
that
would
face
a
bankruptci
judg
would
the
compani
be
elig
for
chapter
style
temporari
bankruptci
some
of
the
advisor
thought
that
pg
e
and
edison
s
financ
were
so
bad
that
chapter
style
temporari
bankruptci
may
not
even
be
an
option
advisor
said
that
a
bankruptci
judg
might
take
a
good
look
at
the
corpor
debt
load
and
decid
that
reorgan
would
do
no
good
and
order
the
compani
into
full
liquid
thi
would
most
certainli
be
guarante
chao
could
the
bankruptci
court
actual
forc
the
puc
to
rais
the
price
of
electr
to
consum
the
legal
basi
for
pass
on
rate
increas
to
consum
is
a
lot
le
solid
than
origin
thought
particularli
if
there
is
widespread
public
outrag
direct
at
the
electr
compani
and
there
is
still
the
question
of
the
unilater
power
of
a
bankruptci
judg
if
the
bankruptci
judg
take
hi
job
of
protect
corpor
asset
serious
and
find
that
pg
e
and
edison
can
not
afford
to
buy
electr
he
could
order
them
to
stop
buy
it
and
thu
lead
to
massiv
power
outag
if
the
util
go
into
bankruptci
the
first
creditor
in
line
would
be
the
lender
and
bondhold
with
collater
pledg
the
state
could
becom
almost
the
last
creditor
in
line
a
it
is
just
anoth
electr
supplier
one
of
the
reason
whi
supplier
won
t
sell
electr
on
credit
to
these
compani
now
if
the
two
compani
went
bankrupt
it
would
be
the
largest
bankruptci
in
histori
strain
just
about
everyon
involv
in
the
process
the
corpor
approv
allow
the
parent
compani
to
segreg
asset
from
the
util
by
the
ferc
for
pg
e
and
alreadi
in
place
for
edison
may
be
far
le
effect
than
the
util
or
the
rate
agenc
current
think
thi
is
particularli
true
if
thi
week
s
audit
show
the
two
corpor
transfer
billion
of
dollar
in
the
last
few
year
into
stock
buyback
and
sharehold
dividend
payment
davi
opinion
poll
show
that
governor
gray
davi
is
get
high
mark
for
hi
job
and
the
util
are
increasingli
view
a
the
culprit
one
of
davi
concern
s
is
accord
to
a
senior
offici
in
the
governor
s
offic
that
a
deal
is
carv
out
that
trigger
a
popular
ballot
initi
which
is
so
anti
util
and
anti
busi
that
it
crippl
futur
growth
in
the
state
accord
to
a
senior
offici
no
one
thought
howard
jarvi
and
hi
properti
tax
initi
would
succeed
in
destroy
our
educ
system
but
he
did
with
one
just
ballot
line
and
a
lot
of
popular
revuls
the
threat
of
direct
popular
action
is
at
least
a
larg
now
a
then
consum
advoc
harvey
rosenfield
is
alreadi
threaten
to
draw
up
a

initi
at
the
first
sign
that
individu
electr
consum
are
be
ask
to
help
the
util
compani
repay
their
debt
through
higher
rate
payer
bill
thi
offici
go
on
to
say
the
anger
at
util
compani
is
so
high
here
that
almost
anyth
rosenfield
could
think
of
would
pa
and
we
couldn
t
do
anyth
about
it
thi
threat
ha
begun
to
complic
the

front
that
had
