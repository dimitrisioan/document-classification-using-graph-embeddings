hi
sharad
i
note
from
our
discuss
earlier
thi
morn
that
you
ve
been
ask
to
sign
off
a
calcul
from
anoth
group
which
is
someth
we
re
ask
to
do
from
time
to
time
i
take
the
view
that
we
in
research
can
ass
a
comput
in
term
of
what
it
achiev
with
respect
to
it
requir
what
it
shortfal
are
and
therefor
what
the
risk
associ
with
use
thi
method
are
we
can
not
provid
an
opinion
on
whether
these
risk
are
accept
to
enron
which
i
feel
fall
firmli
within
rac
territori
thi
then
rais
the
question
of
can
research
sign
off
anyth
for
other
group
after
all
to
sign
off
mean
to
accept
someth
which
our
opinion
in
itself
can
not
do
it
is
most
appropri
for
u
to
provid
a
technic
note
outlin
the
methodolog
risk
and
shortcom
of
a
method
leav
the
formal
sign
off
to
those
best
place
to
ass
these
risk
for
our
compani
the
altern
is
for
multipl
group
each
to
have
their
own
view
on
what
is
accept
risk
for
the
compani
