read

believ

after
we
are
well

with
mr

hi
perspect
although
i
do
suggest
that
if
we
do
decid
to
proceed
we
should
approach
it
by
address
the
issu
mr
mehta
discus
under
a
differ
premis
i
e
sponsor
a
speak
engag
where
one
of
the

topic
would
be
relat

s
topic
allow
u
to
strateg
tell
our
side
of
the
stori
without
it
appear
that
thi
is
a
plan
rebutt
we
should
specif
invit

well
is
that
