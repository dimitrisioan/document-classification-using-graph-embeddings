hi
sheridan
how
are
you
i
hope
that
you
had
a
good
vacat
vasant
and
i
look
at
your
memo
and
found
it
to
be
interest
i
shall
first
briefli
summar
our
understand
of
the
methodolog
you
propos
the
comment
follow
final
i
shall
sketch
a
simpl
ga
field
project
you
can
use
a
a
test
case
in
further
refin
the
model
it
appear
that
you
are
propos
a
state
space
approach
where
probabl
of
differ
state
at
variou
futur
date
are
specifi
the
next
step
is
to
assum
a
discount
rate
and
to
comput
the
present
valu
by
follow
the
branch
from
the
origin
to
one
of
the
termin
point
travers
through
the
tree
in
thi
manner
over
mani
iter
will
permit
u
to
comput
the
averag
present
valu
of
the
project
also
you
are
use
the
simul
to
assign
a
valu
of
the
project
to
each
node
thu
each
node
will
have
a
cash
flow
associ
with
it
which
will
occur
if
the
node
is
reach
and
a
valu
which
is
an
expect
of
the
valu
to
be
realiz
go
forward
if
some
of
these
valu
turn
out
to
be
neg
zero
coupon
risk
free
bond
are
purchas
to
neutral
the
neg
realiz
next
we
find
a
compar
and
appli
the
expect
rate
of
return
back
to
our
project
base
on
the
varianc
of
the
return
we
iter
until
converg
final
we
subtract
the
initi
invest
and
the
comput
risk
capit
from
the
pv
of
the
gross
cash
flow
includ
debt
to
determin
if
the
project
merit
further
consider
comment
clarif
the
money
is
be
set
asid
to
avoid
neg
valu
it
is
not
clear
if
you
mean
the
valu
of
the
cash
flow
or
the
pv
at
the
node
anyhow
we
shall
be
set
asid
money
not
just
for
that
specif
node
but
all
node
at
that
cross
section
of
time
a
the
risk
free
asset
pay
in
all
state
of
natur
thi
will
have
to
be
done
everi
time
there
is
a
neg
realiz
thu
for
the
typic
project
we
have
the
valu
of
risk
capit
may
be
extrem
high
a
we
are
not
follow
a
tail
base
norm
anymor
your
memo
appear
to
suggest
that
debt
capac
is
conting
on
all
valu
be
posit
if
so
we
are
onli
issu
risk
free
debt
also
a
project
with
a
singl
neg
valu
at
each
cross
section
of
time
will
not
have
a
posit
debt
capac
it
seem
that
our
optim
argument
is
the
discount
rate
which
is
obtain
in
each
step
from
the
comparison
invest
by
equat
the
varianc
it
is
not
clear
if
chang
the
discount
rate
will
have
such
an
effect
on
the
project
varianc
so
a
to
lead
to
a
global
converg
also
our
project
ha
a
finit
life
and
the
market
base
asset
will
have
infinit
life
in
the
light
of
thi
fact
how
will
we
defin
the
relev
varianc
is
it
the
spot
varianc
of
the
return
of
the
comparison
invest
final
our
criterion
is
to
subtract
from
the
averag
pv
the
invest
and
also
the
risk
capit
set
risk
capit
to
zero
thi
model
close
resembl
the
intuit
present
valu
criterion
and
endogen
determin
the
discount
rate
ga
field
case
to
facilit
your
think
we
are
provid
a
ga
field
exampl
below
we
invest
x
million
dollar
to
buy
and
develop
a
ga
field
a
profil
of
expect
product
and
varianc
of
the
product
per
year
is
avail
from
the
engin
at
the
begin
product
will
be
autocorrel
a
the
profil
will
shift
up
or
down
base
on
the
actual
ga
reserv
be
more
or
le
than
the
estim
reserv
we
assum
the
life
of
the
field
to
be
year
with
no
salvag
valu
there
are
fix
and
variabl
oper
cost
it
might
be
use
for
you
to
think
about
appli
the
framework
to
thi
problem
do
let
me
know
if
you
have
further
question
