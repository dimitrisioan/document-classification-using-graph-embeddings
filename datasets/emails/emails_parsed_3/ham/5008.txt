the
problem

the

our
research
strategi
is
to
divid
the
price

into
two
compon

can
be

these

are

sourc
for

psycholog

the
common
approach
in
psycholog
model
is
to
use
what
are

these
method
consist

more

the
most
common
econom
model
of
choic
is
the
logit
model
the
problem
with
these
type
of
model
is
that
they
are
not
veri
accur
reflect
of
how
consum
make
choic
on
the
internet
the
first
step
in
our
research
will
be
to
develop
choic

that
captur

custom

optim

the
optim
problem
consist
of
maxim

over
a
certain
plan
horizon
on
the
internet
the
problem
of
maxim
revenu
still
exist
but
there
is
also
a
need
to
learn
about
custom
short
term
profit
is
base
on
sale
but
long
term
profit
is
base
on
how
well
you
know
your
custom
and
are
abl
to
retain
them
the
optim
problem
must
therefor
includ
a
short

and
a
long
