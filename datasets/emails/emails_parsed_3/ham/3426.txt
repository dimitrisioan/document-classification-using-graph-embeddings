here
are
the
review
of
the
ut
energi
financ
program
that
you
request
from
jennif
martinez
mba
class
of
energi
financ
taken
fall
of
the
energi
financ
program
year
ago
wa
veri
good
especi
consid
it
wa
the
first
year
of
the
program
there
were
a
lot
of
guest
speaker
from
variou
energi
compani
who
gave
u
a
lot
of
practic
knowledg
about
the
energi
industri
through
case
studi
lectur
etc
basic
we
learn
all
the
same
financ
concept
and
tool
a
in
the
regular
financ
class
but
all
the
case
and
exampl
were
energi
relat
the
professor
were
good
for
the
most
part
but
didn
t
have
a
great
deal
of
practic
industri
experi
if
i
had
to
guess
the
reason
for
decreas
particip
in
the
program
i
would
probabl
say
it
is
the
professor
ronn
and
titman
are
great
but
known
a
be
veri
technic
and
quantit
some
student
prefer
le
technic
professor
and
class
that
aren
t
limit
to
the
energi
industri
also
the
fact
that
the
class
meet
for
hour
twice
a
week
may
not
be
so
appeal
other
than
those
thing
i
can
t
imagin
whi
there
ha
been
such
a
drop
in
enrol
i
especi
don
t
understand
whi
everi
singl
person
didn
t
drop
for
enron
i
wonder
if
it
ha
someth
to
do
with

it

a
water
down
version
of

the

had
a

i
felt
like

were
reword
to

lingo
we
had
some
veri
good
speaker
but
for
the
most
part
i
did
not
feel
like
the

of

had
enough
energi
focu
i
assum
that
thi
would
get
better
a
the
program
progress
one
reason
that
may
account
for
the
declin
in

is
that
energi

is
a

i
would
have
probabl
not

had
it

two
of

my
opinion
wa
veri
appropri
and
well
thought
out
valu

by

wa
le
than
from

and
case
the

nearli
all
of

discus
pertain

wa
stress
on

a
decent
attempt
at

how
to

i
believ
that
the
univers
energi
financ
faculti
are
tri
to
continu
make

howev
i
do
not
believ
that
they
are
move
fast
enough
or
necessarili
down
the
right
path
to
improv
there
is
a
strong
need
for
more
practic
base
train
on
energi
deriv
similar
to
the
cours
taught
by
paradigm
here
at
enron
the
focu
of
the
univers
teacher
is
quit
theoret
due
in
larg
part
to
their
background
while
the
theoret
basi
is
crucial
to
understand
the
basic
the
real
valu
of
such
a
program
in
my
opinion
is
the
effect
bridg
of
the
theoret
with
the
practic
all
in
one
cours
until
measur
are
taken
to
inject
practic
from
someon
with

experi
i
believ
the
energi
financ

will
continu
to
underdeliv
on
it
object
addit
i
believ
that
the

should
be
