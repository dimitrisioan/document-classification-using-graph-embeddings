thank

these
are
interest
result
i
am
on
vacat
next
week
so
here
are
my
current
thought
i
am
contact
on
my
mobil
if
necessari
ga
to
power
correl
i
see
your
point
about
ga
to
power
correl
onli
affect
var
for
the
combin
ga
and
power
portfolio
and
thi
rais
an
interest
point
at
a
conserv
long
term
correl
combin
var
is
olmm
le
than
previous
expect
so
how
doe
thi
affect
the
limit
breach
strictli
speak
we
are
still
over
our
uk
power
limit
but
the
limit
wa
set
when
we
were
assum
no
ga
power
correl
and
therefor
a
higher
portfolio
var
a
suggest
way
forward
given
the
import
of
the
spread
option
to
the
uk
ga
and
power
book
can
we
alloc
to
the
ga
and
power
book
a
share
of
the
reduct
in

var
ie

var
also
if
i
understand
your
mail
correctli
matrix
impli
ga
power
correl
is
consist
with
our
correl
curv
and
thi
reduc
total
var
by
ol
mm
efa
slot
correl
the
issu
of
whether
our
exist
efa
to
efa
correl
matrix
is
correct
is
a
separ
issu
i
don
t
understand
where
the
matrix
efa
to
efa
correl
come
from
but
i
am
happi
for
you
to
run
some
histor
correl
from
the
forward
curv
use
the
first
year
i
would
suggest
our
origin
matrix
wa
base
on
histor
but
the
analysi
is
worth
do
again
your
matrix
result
certainli
indic
how
import
these
correl
are
close
thought
friday
s
trade
left
u
longer
so
i
would
not
expect
a
limit
breach
on
monday
we
are
still
review
the
shape
of
the
long

curv
and
i
d
like
to
wait
until
both

everybodi
oliv
sent
u
the

for
differ

for
uk
power
portfolio
separ
from
uk
ga
portfolio
first
if
var
is
calcul
accur
the
correl
between
power
and
ga
curv
should
not
affect
var
number
for
power
and
var
number
for
ga
onli
the
aggreg
number
will
be
affect
the
chang
you
see
are
due
to
the
fact
that
we
use
mont
carlo
simul
method
which
accuraci
depend
on
the
number
of
simul
even
if
we
don
t
chang
the
correl
but
use
differ
realiz
of
random
number
we
get
slightli
differ
result
from
the
model
so
to
see
the
effect
of
use
differ
correl
between
ga
and
power
we
should
look
at
the
aggreg
number
i
calcul
weight
correl
base

i
got
from
paul
a
the
weight
along

i
use
the

of

for

bucket
for

the

we

the
