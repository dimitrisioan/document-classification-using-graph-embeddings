suggest
that
we
interview
one
person
plu
sriram
who
alreadi
live
in
houston
karim
look
like
the
most
qualifi
but
my
fear
is
that

not
be
abl
to
afford
him
i
am
assum
that
vinc
will
want
to
hire
at
most
at
the
manag
level
can
you
first
check
and
see
if
karim
would
consid
come
at
a
manag
level
salari
befor
we
spend
time
talk
with
him
if
he
is
too
senior
then
we
should
talk
to
samir
who
look
like
a
more
junior
level
person
