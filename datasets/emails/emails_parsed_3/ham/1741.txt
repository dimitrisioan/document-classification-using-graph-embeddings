after

i
do
not
feel

for
the
follow
reason
enron

there
could
be
substanti
risk
in
test
thi

a
it
would
involv
boil
of

under

i
do
not
believ
that
the

will
produc
ani
signific
quantiti
of
electr
power
the
gener
produc
power
by
induct
that
is
electr
current
is
induc
by
a
chang
magnet
field
the
mechan
power
the
chang
magnet
field
is
the
movement
of
magnet
dipol
which
are
suspend
in
a
boil
medium
a
the
boil
will
produc
a
somewhat
random
movement
of
the
liquid
the
movement
or
chang
in
the
magnet
field
will
be
highli
random
and
thu
not
suitabl
for
produc
a
steadi
or
reliabl
electr
current
i
have
ask
