re
price
credit
on
thousand
of
name
we
can
continu
the
discus
in
tuesday
s
confer
call
but
i
discus
with
ben
about
the
issu
below
and
here
are
some
thought
thi
is
not
a
complet
approach
but
onli
a
start
point
for
discus
the
main
task
is
to
build
a
price
system
for
mani
name
thi
ha
two
compon
how
to
price
a
singl
name
how
to
price
a
liquid
singl
name
how
to
price
an
illiquid
singl
name
how
to
effici
appli
the
methodolog
to
multipl
name
the
approach
i
would
take
for
is
a
defin
a
small
set
of
liquid
name
b
appli
each
of
the
differ
model
we
have
say
the
six
model
ben
ha
mention
below
to
these
name
c
includ
market
price
if
ani
for
these
name
d
sit
with
trader
get
trader
s
intuit
on
where
each
liquid
name
should
price
and
note
thi
on
the
spectrum
of
price
obtain
in
b
and
c
e
tri
to
determin
attribut
of
the
name
that
may
explain
the
dispers
of
the
trader
price
across
the
model
f
quantifi
these
attribut
if
possibl
g
tri
a
differ
set
of
liquid
name
and
repeat
the
process
and
see
if
the
decis
in
the
last
round
still
make
sen
the
approach
for
may
be
a
defin
a
small
set
of
illiquid
name
b
appli
each
of
the
differ
model
we
have
to
these
name
c
sit
with
trader
get
trader
s
intuit
on
where
each
illiquid
name
should
price
and
note
thi
on
the
spectrum
of
price
obtain
in
b
d
tri
to
determin
attribut
of
the
name
that
may
explain
the
dispers
of
the
trader
price
across
the
model
e
check
if
these
are
similar
to
the
attribut
identifi
for
liquid
name
f
defin
a
master
set
of
liquid
name
g
look
for
relationship
by
analyz
cross
section
of
data
between
attribut
or
price
of
illiquid
name
to
those
of
liquid
name
onc
a
map
ha
been
defin
for
an
illiquid
name
to
a
set
of
liquid
name
and
their
attribut
then
thi
map
can
be
enter
into
a
tabl
and
the
price
can
be
autom
for
all
name
in
theori
the
success
will
depend
on
the
success
of
the
round
tabl
session
for
the
approach
for
and
build
a
new
fundament
model
is
alway
a
worthwhil
task
but
we
can
get
go
with
the
abov
approach
immedi
in
parallel
with
develop
ani
new
model
that
we
may
build
new
model
can
be
ad
to
the
suit
of
exist
model
i
do
not
believ
there
will
ever
be
a
singl
model
that
will
answer
all
question
for
all
name
but
rather
we
can
refin
the
map
and
rel
choic
among
model
over
time
which
would
mean
continu
round
tabl
session
with
trader
limit
data
make
calibr
veri
hard
so
i
would
continu
ask
the
question
what
do
we
calibr
throughout
the
discus
for
and
and
thi
may
help
guid
u

subject
price
credit
on

all
our
challeng
for
the
next
few
month
is
to
build
an
autom
system
to
provid
differenti
price
on
thousand
of
credit
by
year
end
most
of
these
credit
will
be
illiquid
in
term
of
market
price
inform
make
the
challeng
harder
and
the
end
result
more
import
in
term
of
competit
price
advantag
what
we
need
is
an
overal
strategi
for
how
we
plan
to
achiev
thi
from
the
quantit
perspect
current
we
have
sever
model
for
credit
price
either
in
use
or
under
develop
fmc
model
default
probabl
approach
use
bloomberg
s
fair
market
par
yield
curv
probabl
are
gener
from
the
riski
libor
then
default
bankruptci
swap
price
comput
use
expect
methodolog
fmc
model
credit
spread
approach
use
the
fmc
then
directli
take
the
libor
credit
spread
at
each
tenor
adjust
for
basi
and
compound
differ
bond
model
fmc
approach
take
the
fmc
a
benchmark
curv
the
model
regress
the
input
bond
specif
to
a
name
on
the
two
best
fit
benchmark
the
result
is
a
zero
yield
curv
with
the
same
shape
a
the
fmc
but
with
the
level
tweak
for
the
specif
issuer
price
are
then
gener
use
both
spread
and
probabl
approach
under
test
bond
model
spline
approach
take
onli
the
bond
specif
to
an
issuer
the
model
fit
an
exponenti
cubic
spline
to
the
zero
coupon
price
curv
then
build
a
zero
yield
curv
from
thi
under
test
market
price
for
certain
liquid
name
or
sector
rate
cd
market
price
are
use
then
recoveri
and
event
discount
use
to
get
bankruptci
swap
price
kmv
use
expect
default
frequenc
edf
from
the
kmv
model
and
databas
we
will
build
a
model
to
price
default
swap
make
appropri
risk
adjust
kmv
is
be
instal
now
so
model
will
be
work
on
next
each
of
these
model
return
a
price
credit
default
and
bankruptci
and
the
accuraci
of
the
price
depend
on
mani
factor
liquid
and
regulatori
differ
between
bond
and
cd
market
recoveri
assumpt
risk
premia
capit
charg
etc
the
aim
will
be
to
accur
price
a
mani
liquid
name
a
possibl
base
upon
these
model
then
use
these
price
alongsid
other
financi
inform
a
the
backbon
to
a
full
autom
price
system
our
input
to
the
propos
price
system
for
a
specif
name
are
model
and
market
price
for
all
issuer
alongsid
name
specif
soft
data
from
credit
report
and
financi
statement
if
the
credit
is
liquid
enough
a
price
will
be
gener
from
their
own
inform
onli
otherwis
the
credit
will
be
map
onto
a
subset
of
liquid
credit
with
financi
inform
and
histor
price
movement
provid
the
map
and
weight
the
model
price
will
then
be
period
adjust
to
align
itself
with
market
or
trader
price
and
thi
adjust
will
feed
back
into
the
weight
and
map
composit
in
loo
term
we
could
think
of
the
system
price
for
an
illiquid
credit
a
be
a
weight
averag
of
liquid
market
price
bond
equiti
default
swap
where
the
weight
are
calibr
use
credit
analysi
financi
ratio
etc
the
key
step
to
implement
such
a
system
will
be
establish
what
exactli
we
want
to
predict
is
it
a
price
a
rate
a
probabl
or
a
score
we
will
need
a
clean
market
histori
to
calibr
to
which
we
onli
realli
have
for
rate
we
will
then
need
to
develop
a
map
from
rate
score
to
price
get
and
clean
the
histor
financi
and
credit
data
requir
to
calibr
the
model
build

ie
the

seem
the
obviou
candid

which
exact
method
and
softwar
packag
to
use
determin
an

name
with

into

get
the

in

to

such
a

such
a

would
