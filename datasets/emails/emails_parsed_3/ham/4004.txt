with
the
analyst
associ
program
that

be
of
interest
to

a
texa
a
m
recruit
meet

learn
that

scienc
i
wonder
whi

not
a
busi
need
for
math
major
like
liber
art
major
they
said
math
major
were
onli
consid
on
a
person
by
person
basi
in
my
opinion
math
major
have
mani
of
the
same
skill
a
financ
major
and
can
easili
adjust
to
account
rotat
a
well
i
did
last
summer
and
financ
major
in
the
program
are
forc
to
everi
year
i
think
that
enron
is
miss
out
on
mani
qualifi
candid
by
limit
their
recruit
effort
at
texa
a
m
the
career
center
ask
compani
for
a
list
of
major
they
are
target
and
onli
allow
those
major
to
sign
up
for
interview
through
the
career
center
i
sent
my
resum
to
enron
and
ask
to
be
includ
in
the
interview
process
on
campu
howev
mani
other
math
major
had
not
heard
of
enron
or
the
other
compani
and
assum
that
there
wa
no
place
for
a
math
major
at
a
compani
like
enron
mani
math
major
want
to
continu
their
educ
becom
teacher
or
work
for
an
actuari
firm
howev
mani
are
undecid
we
are
constantli
told
of
the
mani
busi
possibl
avail
to
math
major
by
our
teacher
and
staff
but
mani
undergradu
are
still
not
sure
exactli
what
math
major
can
contribut
in
a
busi
environ
by
not
mention
math
major
to
the
career
center
a
veri
simpl
and
inexpens
step
enron
is
lose
out
on
a
veri
talent
pool
of
peopl
while
it
would
be
nice
to
get
the
math
major
that
knew
about
enron
alreadi
had
thoroughli
research
all
compani
and
determin
that
math
major
would
fit
perfectli
and
went
the
extra
step
to
send
enron
their
resum
outsid
the
career
center
system
there
are
mani
qualifi
student
who
do
not
do
thi
and
opt
for
other
compani
who
did
mention
math
major
i
call
a
manag
in
the
a
a
program
to
suggest
that
we
consid
at
least
mention
math
major
to
the
career
center
i
realiz
that
it
may
cost
more
to
activ
pursu
them
talk
to
teacher
and
attend
math
societi
event
howev
i
told
her
that
includ
them
at
the
career
center
would
be
veri
inexpens
for
enron
she
reiter
that
they
saw
no
busi
need
for
math
major
and
that
if
more
upper
level
peopl
began
request
them
it
would
be
consid
i
search
for
mathemat
on
the
enron
job
websit
and
had
a
surpris
number
of
result
i
know
that
your
group
could
use
math
major
a
well
howev
thi
still
may
be
too
small
a
number
to
merit
a
focu
from
the
a
a

depart
i
just
want
to
bring
it
to
