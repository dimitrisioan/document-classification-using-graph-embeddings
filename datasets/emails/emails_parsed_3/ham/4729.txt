i
think
it
is
import
to
keep
a
good
relationship
with
pserc
but
a
of
now
it
is
not
worth
two
day
of
your
time
to
attend
the
board
meet
besid
sinc
we
are
not
a
sponsor
yet
we
have
virtual
no
voic
in
the
meet
and
our
presenc
sometim
is
awkward
again
even
if
we
are
one
of
the
thirti
or
so
sponsor
our
voic
is
rather
limit
for
most
of
the
other
sponsor
have
differ
concern
from
our
one
way
to
remedi
thi
is
to
individu
sponsor
some
research
project
via
