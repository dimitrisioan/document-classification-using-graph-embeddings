is
an

on

discus
the
advers
econom
impact
of
right
of
first
refus
an
option
to
first
refus
to
match
a
competitor
s
offer
is
a
restraint
of
free
trade
and
an
impedi
to
effici
in
the
marketplac
thi
econom
conclus
is
unambigu
if
an
incumb
ha
the
right
to
match
an
offer
made
by
a
competitor
for
an
item
or
servic
of
valu
then
few
competitor
will
invest
the
time
and
expens
necessari
to
prepar
and
submit
offer
those
offer
will
be
lower
than
they
would
have
been
otherwis
and
the
contract
will
often
be
award
to
an
ineffici
incumb
instead
of
a
more
effici
challeng
in
a
tradit
auction
where
all
bid
are
seal
and
the
item
up
for
auction
is
award
to
the
highest
bidder
we
can
safe
predict
the
item
will
be
award
to
the
bidder
who
valu
it
the
most
at
a
price
reflect
the
full
valu
of
the
item
up
for
auction
thi
is
the
effici
result
in
a
market
economi
becaus
the
financ
of
the
high
bid
reflect
resourc
freeli
alloc
to
the
high
bidder
if
the
auction
ha
open
bid
we
can
again
safe
predict
the
item
to
be
award
to
the
correct
bidder
albeit
at
a
slightli
lower
price
to
the
donor
of
the
item
sinc
the
bidder
with
the
highest
valuat
can
simpli
increment
by
an
infinitesim
amount
the
second
highest
valuat
now
in
a
modifi
auction
where
an
incumb
bidder
ha
the
right
to
match
the
highest
bid
and
retain
the
item
for
himself
each
compet
bidder
must
justifi
hi
own
due
dilig
and
bid
prepar
expens
against
the
follow
and
like
scenario
the
incumb
doe
not
spend
himself
for
due
dilig
but
instead
use
these
save
to

financ
hi

the
top
bid
from
a

simpli
put
the
incumb
with
a
right
of

refus
can
be
safe
predict
to
simpli
match
their
competitor
s
bid
by
rule
of
thumb
but
the
incumb
s
valuat
of
the
item
up
for
auction
can
be
le
than
the
valuat
of
the
competitor
by
the
amount
of

thi
