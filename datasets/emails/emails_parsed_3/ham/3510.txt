after
the
initi
one

there
are
still
limit
a
to
what
you

so
i
will
need

so
we
can
tri
to
revis

so
that
you

be
legal
for
exampl
in

languag
regard
releas
of

it
state
that

have
the
right
to
use
copi
and
modifi
the
sourc
code
sole
for
our
intern
purpos
in
connect
with
support
mainten
and
oper
of
the
softwar
do
yall
plan
to
revers
engin
decompil
etc
do
you
plan
on
use
ani
of
their
code
to
creat
our
own
product
if
so
i
think
these
are
go
to
be
a
problem
the
latter
would
be
an
infring
issu
unless
we
were
to
contract
to
do
so
plea
let
me
know
more
detail
of
your
plan
so
i
can
see
how
we
need
to
proceed
in
thi
area
