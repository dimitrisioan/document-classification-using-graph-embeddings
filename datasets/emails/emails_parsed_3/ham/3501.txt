you
kindli
offer
that
you

thi
still
possibl
we
realis
that
you

le
went

and
if
you

would
be

thank
juli
we
re
get
close
prefac
one
of
our
main
object
in
write
energi
deriv
price

ha
been
to
bring
togeth
a
mani
of
the
variou
approach
for
the

risk
manag
energi
deriv
a
possibl
to
discus
in
depth
the
model
and
to
show
how
they
relat
to
each
other
in
thi
way
we
hope
to
help
the
reader
to
analys
the
differ
model
price
a
wide
rang
of
energi
deriv
or
to
build
a
risk

system
which
use
a
consist
model
framework
we
believ
that
for
practition
thi
last
point
is
veri
import
and
we
continu
to
stress
in
our
articl
and
present
the
danger
of
have
flaw
risk

and
give

inconsist

see
also
other

howev
it
is
not
our
wish
to
concentr

one
particular
model

model

we
believ
that
the

rest
with

although
it
will
probabl
be
clear
from

discus
the

we

we
therefor

give
a
clear
account
a
possibl
of

so
that
the

can
