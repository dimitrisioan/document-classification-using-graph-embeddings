barbara
vinc
kaminski
had
forward
me
the
artwork
for
the
mug
be
work
on
for
the
seminar
seri
for
review
comment
we
in
public
relat
were
wonder
if
you
might
be
abl
to
incorpor
the
enron
logo
in
the
design
could
you
plea
contact
me
and
advis
if
thi
is
possibl
we
tri
to
use
both
the
enron
logo
and
the
rice
univers
seal
it
just
didn
t
work
there
seem
to
be
a
few
problem
the
first
wa
color
a
is
the
mug
will
be
black
with
metal
gold
text
introduc
the
other
color
wa
distract
our
admiss
depart
use
a
black
and
gold
mug
that
is
quit
stun
and
it
seem
to
go
with
financ
that
wa
my
motiv
the
second
problem
wa
that
the
logo
themselv
even
if
it
made
sen
to
do
them
in
gold
made
the
design
too
busi
a
lot
of
the
appeal
in
these
word
mug
is
the
clean
linear
look
final
i
think
lack
of
compani
and
compet
busi
school
logo
increas
the
chanc
that
the
academ
who
come
to
present
their
work
at
our
workshop
will
display
thi
mug
on
their
desk
or
on
their
shelv
i
think
the
mug
will
look
quit
stun
and
i
think
the
display
of
financ
term
will
make
it
an
interest
convers
piec
i
ve
never
seen
anyth
like
it
in
academ
let
alon
in
financ
i
think
enron
s
sponsorship
of
the
seminar
seri
will
get
notic
when
peopl
follow
their
interest
in
the
mug
to
say
what
is
thi
where
d
thi
come
from
i
m
hope
thi
version
will
be
accept
to
you
for
our
first
shot
at
thi
plea
