i
have
two
thing
bite
me
first
is
time
i
need
to
turn
a
draft
for
hannon
and
rice
asap
so
the
valu
of
a
delib
approach
to
come
up
with
a
v
r
polici
will
quickli
evapor
if
we
take
week
to
studi
what
the
polici
should
say
second
i
have
a
uniqu
situat
our
concept
of
v
r
is
realli
unlik
the
rest
of
enron
s
today
what
happen
today
is
that
network
engin
unilater
make
decis
about
deploy
configur
and
other
matter
which
effect
the
long
and
short
of
our
asset
contract
portfolio
that
they
view
strictli
from
a
network
oper
standpoint
a
good
exampl
wa
a
decis
to
move
our
primari
terapop
three
larg
server
store
gigabyt
each
from
portland
to
la
the
server
are
alreadi
in
place
and
purchas
so
no
capit
wa
involv
but
the
decis
ha
huge
ramif
on
the
futur
la
new
york
and
other
bandwidth
usag
and
that
cost
money
now
it
could
be
that
the
la
new
york
cost
is
cheaper
than
the
portland
new
york
cost
the
whole
point
is
no
one
know
what
our
valu
at
risk
polici
attempt
to
corral
is
these
type
of
decis
and
put
them
into
the
hand
of
the
risk
manag
group
where
the
decis
will
be
made
with
at
least
some
econom
work
behind
it
i
realli
see
the
eb
v
r
polici
to
be
misnam
sinc
we
don
t
realli
have
the
math
done
to
calc
v
r
it
realli
is
a
volumetr
base
control
polici
that
say
you
can
t
make
network
chang
over
xx
amount
of
megabyt
a
storag
measur
or
oc
equival
a
bandwidth
measur
without
risk
manag
make
or
approv
the
decis
i
do
believ
that
with
research
s
help
we
can
in
time
actual
calcul
the
v
r
impact
of
such
decis
at
that
time
the
polici
should
be
modifi
to
set
metric
base
on
the
v
r
calcul
so
if
you
have
an
open
enough
mind
to
let
u
co
op
your
word
for
a
minut
we
need
to
start
turn
the
mind
of
the
network
industri
peopl
into
think
about
their
decis
a
have
valu
effect
said
directli
kevin
hannon
ha
given
me
author
to
write
a
polici
to
move
control
over
signific
network
chang
from
the
field
to
the
trade
floor
and
i
am
go
to
issu
someth
now
to
effectu
that
so
i
realli
want
your
view
on
what
we
are
do
but
thought
you
need
some
flavor
and
an
sen
of
the

and
would
like
your

thi
is
go
to
be
tough
becaus
i
m
not
sure
we
have
implement
a
similiar
polici
across

of
our

book
that
is
we
look
to
bring
in
all
the
accrual
oper

a
well
a
the

lambda
to
have
a
real
live

what
is
the

thi
done
with
a
mixtur

accrual
asset
add
the
spice
of
a

valuat
and
thi
will
be
tough
to
quantifi
and
model
step
configur
system
and
valu
it
step
calcul
a

on
thi
we
will
need
