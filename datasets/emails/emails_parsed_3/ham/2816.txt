all
attach
is
anjam
s
reason
and
final
version
of
the
uk
ppi
pllu
model
the
uk
inflat
book
s
main
exposur
is
to
two
ppi
index
the
pllu
and
the
dzcv
through

both
are
ppi
output
index
with

the
onli
signific
differ
between
the
two
is
the
presenc
of

the

in
use
escal
the

index
by
the

factor
howev
with
the

price
fluctuat
in
recent

differ
model
for
the

index
would
reflect
better
the
natur
of
their
driver
anjam
concentr
on
the
pllu
index
first
and
he
will
shortli
construct
one
for
the
dzcv
base
on
the

methodolog
but
without
the

crude
curv
the
new

achiev
the
two
main
object
of

curv
it
is
significantli
more

the

by
about

the

also

thi
show
that
if
we
had
more
detail
in

then
the
ppi

would
reflect

we
use

the

dear
all
we
thought
it
might
be
use
to
incorpor
brent

a
an
explanatori
variabl
for

it
wa
found
that
deviat
of

brent
crude
from
the
long

averag
of

the
best
form
of
the
variabl
to
use
for
predict
the
brent

produc
by
the

is

approx
comparison
of

a
you
can
see
the
two
equat
differ
in
the
veri
short

and
veri
long

the
inclus
of
deviat
of
brent

lead

the

predict
pllu
in
the

over
the
next
six

the
curv
are
then
veri
similar
until
when
the

includ

break

to
the
upsid
rel
to
the
fall
rpi
curv
the
model
base
pure
on
rpi
hug
the
rpi
curv
much
more
close
in
the
longer
term
thi
is
onli
import
to
the
extent
that
we
have
larg
posit
beyond
which
we
don
t
suggest
what
could
be
use
now
is
a
differ
specifi
model
design
to
forecast
onli
the
next
month
use
auto
regress
or
auto

error
term
thi
model
would
be
far
more
accur
in
the
near
term
and
we
could
includ
thi
inform
onto
the
front
of
thi
long
term
model
thi
may
be
use
despit
the
fact
that
most
of
our
exposur
is
in
futur
time
bucket
back
test
all
the

give

on

hope
we
can
discu

and
