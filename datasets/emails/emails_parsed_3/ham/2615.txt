var
for
metal
it
is
my
prefer
to
have
an
aggreg
var
methodolog
for
the
metal
busi
a
soon
a
possibl
version
la
i
do
not
want
to
poison
progress
with
my
opiniion
but
i
think
that
the
critic
first
step
is
to
find
a
way
to
aggreg
posit
in
coars
bucket
perhap
sacrif
precis
for
speed
base
on
rule
that
oerat
can
deliv
research
can
stand
behind
and
commerci
will
accept
and
use
an
equal
coars
var
calcul
the
equival
of
ad
hoc
var
that
can
be
deliv
to
the
offici
book
and
record
on
a
daili
basi
thi
i
believ
would
be
accept
for
a
month
time
frame
at
which
time
we
get
versionlb
a
oppos
to
wait
month
to
implement
a
better
process
and
have
noth
in
the
interim
ultim
i
would
look
for
version
a
to
be
deliv
and
veri
defend
by
thi
will
requir
indulg
and
compromis
on
all
front
but
i
can
not
conceiv
of
a
better
way
pleas
let
me
know
if
thi
is
consist
with
your
understand
a
critic
point
from
my
perspect
is
that
the
mg
commerci
team
and
metal
oper
staff
understand
their
role
in
make
thi
happen
and
willing
to
accept
the
consequ
i
look
for
you
to
take
the
lead
a
leader
of
the
integr
to
do
so
if
you
need
ani
input
from
the
rest
of
u
to
underscor
the
import
pleas
let
u
know
a
i
allud
to
on
the
phone
the
peopl
in
houston
that
have
been
involv
in
the
var
process
have
been
through
an
extraordinari
period
of
detail
scrutini
of

by
commerci
and
have
been
hinder
by
the
lack
of

understand
by
all
parti
a
their
respons
given
the
distanc
and
the
new
of
the

i
fear
that
thi
could
set
u
all
up
for
some
surpris
and
some
veri
uncomfort
commun
much
of
