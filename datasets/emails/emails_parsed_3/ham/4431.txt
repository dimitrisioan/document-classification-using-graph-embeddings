hello
all
append
below
you
ll
find
a
summari
of
idea
that
peopl
have
contribut
sinc
we
at
caida
began
to
get
the
metric
wg
start
some
of
thi
materi
ha
alreadi
appear
on
the
metric
mail
list
the
older
materi
come
from
person
email
i
m
post
it
again
to
give
u
all
some
more
idea
to
think
about
for
those
who
are
abl
to
attend
the
wg
meet
in
san
jose
thi
thursday
mar
i
d
like
to
spend
time
in
the
morn
get
to
know
about
attende
interest
and
experi
in
make
internet
measur
i
suggest
that
a
good
way
to
do
thi
would
be
to
have
each
group
give
a
short
minut
respons
time
and
thi
get
even
more
interest
you
onli
need
to
be
abl
to
see
traffic
in
one
direct
from
client
to
server
to
get
a
fairli
accur
round
trip
time
from
the
client
to
the
server
irrespect
of
how
far
away
the
client
is
from
your
measur
host
becaus
of
tcp
three
way
handshak
for
connect
establish
when
you
see
the
open
syn
you
wait
for
the
client
to
ack
the
server
s
syn
ack
and
you
have
the
client
server
round
trip
time
i
think
you
ve
actual
alreadi
done
some
of
thi
we
could
also
potenti
tri
to
correl
dn
queri
and
tcp
connect
perhap
determin
some
probabl
in
a
given
environ
of
a
host
initi
a
tcp
connect
to
a
host
for
which
it
just
receiv
an
a
record
and
track
variou
applic
level
respons
time
i
d
person
love
to
have
a
lot
of
data
on
the
ratio
of
dn
respons
time
to
tcp
transfer
time
for
http
connect
even
if
the
measur
make
no
attempt
to
discern
what
constitut
a
web
transact
to
the
user
a
full
page
usual
mani
tcp
connect
anyway
i
think
there
are
some
fairli
interest
thing
we
can
measur
with
simpl
techniqu
these
are
just
some
simpl
one
there
may
be
some
interest
thing
we
could
do
by
dig
into
payload
of
a
few
of
the
other
highli
util
applic
but
do
it
for
tcp
is
a
nightmar
perfom
wise
but
we
now
have
the
basic
infrastructur
to
do
thing
with
dn
over
udp
we
can
probabl
cover
ani
open
udp
protocol
without
incur
perform
penalti
that
would
make
it
complet
unus
snmp
for
exampl
while
it
applic
is
limit
network
servic
provid
would
find
round
trip
time
inform
for
snmp
packet
from
their
network
manag
station
to
agent
veri
use
i
think
there
are
some
rudimentari
thing
we
can
do
with
tcp
a
well
and
i
also
think
some
site
would
be
interest
in
have
some
rudimentari
inform
for
exampl
a
weight
by
traffic
round
trip
time
distribut
for
tcp
traffic
to
from
all
network
with
which
you
commun
say
at
granular
thi
give
site
a
notion
of
how
close
they
are
to
those
they
talk
to
most
frequent
with
a
littl
more
work
we
could
probabl
make
reason
bandwidth
estim
for
everi
end
network
for
which
we
see
tcp
data
we
could
certainli
get
a
reason
number
for
the
maximum
observ
bandwidth
these
method
also
decoupl
the
measur
from
the
traffic
while
we
all
know
the
valu
of
that
i
think
it
s
signific
in
that
activ
prober
can
be
run
on
the
same
host
decoupl
from
the
actual
measur
and
with
timestamp
come
from
kernel
space
bpf
i
ve
been
think
about
thi
for
a
long
time
becaus
eventu
i
d
like
skitter
and
other
tool
to
be
abl
to
do
use
tcp
packet
for
probe
with
no
need
for
thing
like
ip
firewal
code
if
i
can
just
properli
time
non
block
connect
and
count
on
the
passiv
tool
to
see
the
syn
and
syn
ack
i
can
use
ani
tcp
port
for
round
trip
time
measur
and
not
trick
my
kernel
by
send
tcp
packet
on
a
raw
socket
i
need
feedback
from
the
passiv
tool
for
trace
like
skitter
it
need
to
know
when
a
repli
ha
been
seen
from
a
hop
and
when
the
destin
ha
been
reach
but
it
s
not
difficult
simpl
bytestream
orient
ipc
is
suffici
go
further
i
like
the
idea
propos
by
some
other
mayb
fund
at
thi
point
i
m
not
track
it
of
instrument
the
freenix
tcp
ip
stack
a
lot
of
use
inform
could
be
pull
from
the
stack
but
eventu
someon
s
go
to
have
to
come
up
with
what
piec
of
inform
are
desir
enough
for
someon
to
want
their
stack
instrument
and
it
ll
have
to
be
somewher
between
what
s
current
implement
and
a
full
blown
meter
system
like
rtfm
and
i
think
in
the
interim
there
are
a
lot
of
thing
we
could
do
use
libpcap
on
our
local
machin
non
promiscu
and
in
user
space
safe
easi
to
implement
and
test
to
me
the
benefit
here
are
a
user
is
like
to
have
a
tangibl
well
understood
relationship
with
their
workstat
understood
by
them
thi
is
particularli
true
for
those
of
u
with
network
expertis
so
it
s
at
least
plausibl
that
we
can
find
correl
of
measur
with
user
experi
in
a
fairli
short
period
of
time
help
u
hone
in
on
what
s
use
even
if
we
onli
find
weak
correl
for
whatev
reason
onc
a
correl
exist
more
peopl
will
be
interest
in
help
with
develop
becaus
it
ll
be
someth
they
ll
use
person
we
re
essenti
guarante
to
see
traffic
in
both
direct
i
d
person
be
interest
in
tri
to
find
some
small
set
of
inform
that
correl
to
user
experi
so
that
it
doesn
t
take
a
terabyt
of
disk
and
processor
to
deal
with
data
from
say
desktop
anyway
just
some
random
thought
the
hard
part
for
me
at
the
moment
is
think
about
use
gener
and
infrastructur
to
support
them
cindi
bickerstaff
respond
we
re
just
start
to
captur
the
ms
and
window
size
negoti
between

to
get
an
idea
of
what
is
typic

wonder
if
daniel

could
do
that
too
from

caida

the
