model
simpl
issu
brad
here
are
my
thought
on
your
concern
you
need
curv
input
thi
is
an
it
job
i
can
help
you
for
the
curv
befor
the
system
is
properli
set
up
intrins
valu
v
time
valu
the
intrins
valu
depend
on
how
you
alloc
the
volum
if
you
have
a
rough
idea
about
the
alloc
a
you
did
in
the
spreadsheet
we
can
caluc
the
intrins
valu
within
the
model
the
differ
between
the
total
and
the
intrins
will
be
the
option
time
valu
howev
by
pre
alloc
volum
you
kill
some
option
in
the
storag
model
volum
are
alloc
dynam
therefor
it
is
hard
to
distinguish
the
intrins
v
time
valu
factor
of
load
factor
of
load
are
use
to
give
histor
correl
matrix
the
three
factor
correspond
to
paral
shift
slop
and
curvetur
the
covari
matrix
in
the
model
is
express
in
the
form
covar
row
vol
i
correl
i
j
colum
vol
j
where
vol
are
the
impli
volatil
from
the
vol
curv
correl
i
j
l
l
residu
small
where
l
is
the
factor
of
load
matrix
so
in
a
simpl
word
the
factor
of
load
say
x
are
a
simplier
way
for
u
to
rememb
the
histor
correl
matrix
say
x
let
me
know
if
i
can
offer
further
help

thank
for
your

with

revis
storag
valuat
your
right
to
point
out
the
similar
to

bid
here
are
some
basic
question
tie
to
implement
and
calibr
model
infrastructur
it
support
i
obvious
need
to
re
build
my
link
to
the
forward
curv
a
the
model
is
not
work
in
my
new
locat
short
term
aprox
month
i
d
like
to
establish
a
link
to
the
ena
databas
egsprod
in
order
to
fetch
the
long
date
price
and
volatil
curv
my
link
to
ena
forward
curv
would
then
be
quickli
sever
in
favor
of
the
curv
gener
by
the
new
bridgelin
entiti
databas
name
and
data
structur
yet
to
be
defin
howev
it
not
clear
to

what
is
requir
in

process
to
support
your

definit
of

requir
you
provid
is
appreci
i
ll
then
work
with
sandra
henderson
an
enron
employe
provid
our
it
support
to
ensur
the
model
continu
to
work
regardless
ani
downstream
system
chang
that
may
take
place
a
we
build
and
establish
our
separ
trade
system
or

meanwhil
is

anyth
you
think
you
can
do
to
ensur
im
up

run
quickli

link
excel

to

curv
will
be
key
to
all
our
price
project
not
just
the
storag
model
suppli
by
research
intrins
v
extrins
valu
it
would
be
help
to
decompos
the
model
s
calcul
storag
price
and
to
distinguish
intrins
v
extrins
time
or
option
valu
i
could
easili
link
a
new
spreadsheet
tab
to
your
model
input
and
to
calcul
the
intrins
valu
and
then
through
a
simpl
differ
i
could
determin
the
extrins
valu
ive
includ
a
simpl
spreadsheet
calcul
for
the
intrins
valu
for
review
i
want
to
share
thi
with
you
to
ask
the
follow
doe
the
natur
of
the
model
defin
intrins
and
extrins
valu
differ
than
the
simpl

propos
do
you
think
it
would
make
sens
to
do
the
simpl
valu
decomposit
in
the
backcod
c
code
via
dll
in
order
to
ensur
run
time
is
faster
my
goal
here
is
straightforward
a
to
better
understand
the
model
and
it
sensit
and
b
to
determin
if
and
when
the
option
approach
is
associ
signific
valu
abov
and
beyond
the
simpl
present
valu
of
the
time
spread
factor
load
what
are
some
of
the
thought
or
insight
you
can
offer
with
regard
to
factor
load
and
how
i
should
interpret
the
graph
of
the

calcul
factor

have
alway
been
a
mysteri
to
me

what

if
anyth
is

expect

key
to

calibr
we
are
prepar
a

should
allow
