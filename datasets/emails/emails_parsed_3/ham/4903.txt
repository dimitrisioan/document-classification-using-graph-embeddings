i
spoke
recent
with
jim
fallon
the
current
head
trader
in

and
we
put
togeth
a
short
list
of
topic
of
interest
where
you
might
be
abl
to
help
educ
u
i
put
these
in
the
order
of
interest
to
mr
fallon
where
will
bandwidth

go
the
direct
of
price
obvious
is
the
concern
of
ani
trader
we
realiz
that
technolog
innov
will
continu
to
drive
down
price
but
are
still
interest
in
tri
to
quantifi
how
fast
price
will
fall
if
there
are
like
to
be
certain
bottleneck
in
the
fiber
network
where
you
could
see
price
stabl
or
rise
for
some
length
of
time
if
there
are
applic
on
the
horizon
which
would
use
such
prodigi
amount
of
bandwidth
a
to
have
some
effect
on
price
and
if
there
is
a
ration
way
of
tri
to
quantifi
the
time
and
effect
on
price
of
new
technolog
the
term
bandwidth
might
primarili
mean
lit
fiberopt
capac
but
could
also
incompass

s
abil
to

provis
there
may
be
two
separ
question
to
ask
here
first
in
the
context
of
the
current
market
or
the
market
which
may
develop
in
the
next
year
will
the
metarout
be
a
commerci
viabl
product
that
is
will
it
address
an
actual
need
in
the
market
or
would
it
be
more
cost
effect
just
to
use
technician
with
jumper
cabl
to
provis
circuit
the
second
question
our
first
real
technic
question
is
the
metarout
technolog
scalabl
befor
start
on
thi
project
vinc
and
i
will
need
to
make
the
proper
introduct
with
the
principl
who
are
implement
thi
technolog
aggreg
of
load
a
recur
question
come
from
a
number
of
area
such
a
ip
network
storag
and
stream
medium
transport
sale
what
valu
can
i
get
form
aggreg
custom
each
of
which
ha
some
type
of
stochast
load
profil
giusepp
touch
on
thi
problem
a
it
relat
to
ip
transport
but
it
may
be
interest
to
tri
and
look
in
more
detail
the
main
stumbl
block
may
be
that
we
current
have
basic
no
actual
custom
data
i
am
told
that
in
a
few
month
we
will
have
some
more
use
histori
my
understand
is
that
what
will
be
avail
will
be
minut
averag
of
usag
so
we
still
will
not
know
on
a
short
time
scale
what
the
distribut
of
load
look
like
i
hope
that
thi
give
you
enough
inform
to
get
some
idea
of
what
our
concern
are
at
thi
point
pleas
let
me
know
your
thought
about
these
topic
i
would
expect
for
instanc
that
question
number
may
not
be
reason
a
a
research
project
but
might
be
a
question
which
you
would
feel
comfort
in
address
by
give
u
your
qualit
opinion
mayb
in
the
form
of
a
talk
here
at
enron
again
let
me
know
your
thought
and
i
look
forward
to
see
you
again
