integ
packag
is
someth
i
ve
been
present
with
for
the

mgt
group
just
got
a
coupl
of
analyst
to
hack
it
togeth
includ
natasha
danilochkina
then
ask
me
to
tidi
it
up
when
it
didn
t
work
they
are
go
to
use
their
exist
faulti
model
for
now
to
meet
their
project
deadlin
and
i
m
sketch
out
a
proper
mathemat
spec
for
the
problem
i
ve
persuad
them
that
thi
sort
of
busi
critic
system
should
be
develop
properli
by
research
and
they
now
seem
happi
to
fall
into
line
their
wilton
plant
optim
wa
develop
by
one
peter
morawitz
the
guy
i
hope
to
recruit
into
research
and
they
obvious
didn
t
realis
he
wa
better
than
averag
at
quantit
model
anyway
they
now
accept
that
do
it
properli
will
take
month
rather
than
week
and
i
ll
have
a
freer
hand
in
my
choic
of
model
tool
so
a
chat
with
tom
would
be
extrem
valuabl

s
whi
you

entir
avoid
question
about
discount
and
risk
neutral
or
lack
of
it
