thi
is

well
written
and
will
serv
the
reader
well
a
few
comment
when
i
think
about
the
taxonomi

the

i
typic

simul
delta
approach
is
the
way
of
repres
a
posit
in
a

i
would
defin
mont
carlo
a
an
approach
base
on
statist
simul
of
behavior
of
all
the
market
price
rate
etc
and
revalu
of
the

the
revalu
may
be

or
may
be

the
main
benefit
of
use
the

in
the

is
the
abil
to
captur
the

of
the

would

i
would
mention
that
