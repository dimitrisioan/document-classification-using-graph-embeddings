how
can
you
sell
this
software
as
oem
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
is
there
a
catch
there
is
no
catch
the
software
versions
that
we
sell
are
oem
original
equipment
manufacturer
which
means
you
will
receive
the
installation
cds
only
they
do
not
come
in
their
original
retail
packing
and
do
not
include
the
manual
we
do
guarantee
that
all
programs
are
the
full
working
retail
versions
no
demos
or
academic
versions
when
you
order
you
will
receive
all
materials
required
for
a
complete
installation
or
your
money
back
why
pay
hundreds
of
dollars
more
when
you
can
get
exactly
the
same
but
oem
cd
you
don
t
have
to
pay
that
much
for
the
fancy
box
and
manuals
why
is
your
software
so
inexpensive
compared
to
the
other
retailers
we
minimize
our
overhead
by
stocking
mostly
top
selling
software
only
and
try
to
get
the
best
deals
for
them
we
also
sell
what
are
called
oem
versions
the
same
software
as
the
box
version
without
the
box
and
the
manual
by
foregoing
the
fancy
box
and
typically
slim
manuals
you
end
up
saving
a
considerable
amount
thank
you
if
you
