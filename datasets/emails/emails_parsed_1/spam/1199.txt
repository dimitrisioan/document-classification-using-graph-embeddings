systems
results
are
really
all
that
matters
see
what
our
current
students
have
to
say
i
have
also
created
a
very
elaborate
spreadsheet
where
i
am
tracking
my
activities
i
keep
one
page
which
tracks
my
trading
history
this
is
only
for
trades
which
have
completed
from
start
to
finish
to
date
i
have
completed
trades
for
an
overall
profit
of
at
an
average
percent
roi
i
also
have
several
other
trades
that
are
active
one
of
which
has
already
doubled
in
value
at
which
time
i
sold
half
of
the
options
in
that
trade
and
paid
for
the
trade
it
is
now
a
free
trade
i
also
have
a
worksheet
which
tracks
my
overall
present
position
in
all
of
my
trades
this
one
ignores
the
cost
of
the
underlying
stocks
for
instance
in
my
collar
trades
but
is
rather
a
measure
of
cashflow
my
current
ytd
total
is
over

i
have
been
trading

october
of
i
started
with
and
within
year
my
portfolio
is
worth
over
spread
trade
strategies
are
simple
and
easy
to
understand
i
was
about

give
up
on
the
stock
market

program
i
have
learned
how
to
apply
spread
trade
strategies
successfully
it
is
great
that

very
little
money

can
grow
quickly
without
the
fear
of
losing
your
entire
investment
ruben
p
to
date
has
a
portfolio
valued
over
k
keeping
a
close
eye
on
netflix
over
the
last
couple
of
months
i
sold
long
term
short
puts
out
of
the
money
when
the
stock
indicated
oversold
conditions
as
the
stock
bounced
back
and
showed
over
bought
signals
i
offloaded
the
puts
and
sold
calls
against
my
stock
last
month
netflix
options
alone
made
me
over
opening
up
the
wealthbuilder
a
few
weeks
ago
i
saw
a
recommendation
for
a
call
calendar
at
the
time
i
wanted
to
enter
a
credit
trade
instead
of
a
debit
trade
and
entered
a
bear
call
based
on
technical
indicators
all
options
expired
worthless
and
i
pocketed
the
entire
credit
this
month
i
placed
some
covered
calls
and
bull
puts
on
taser
as
it
rocketed
up
i
closed
all
positions
after
days
with
a
profit
many
companies
proudly
advertise
big
percentage
gains
many
times
i
ve
asked
those
companies
if
those
big
gains
hide
big
losses
all
with
the
exception
of
sts
was
hiding
big
losing
trades
my
record
this
year
is
out
of
the
stocks
i
ve
traded
have
made
money
it
s
not
the
out
of
that
fasi
and
greg
get
but
with
each
month
i
refine
my
system
and
keep
closing
the
gap
the
education
sts
provides
is
invaluable
without
it
my
approach
would
have
been
that
of
a
gambler
with
it
my
approach
is
systematic
and
disciplined
and
consistently
profitable
