the
biggest
financial
bubble
in
history
in
the
article
after
the
fall
in
the
june
issue
of
economist
magazine
real
estate
was
called
the
biggest
financial
bubble
in
history
what
makes
this
real
estate
market
so
risky
is
that
the
crazy
speculation
in
housing
has
spread
around
the
world
people
continue
to
buy
houses
simply
because
prices
are
rising
without
any
regard
to
fundamentals
this
is
similar
to
what
happened
with
the
stock
market
during
the
s
when
investors
bought
shares
of
profitless
companies
just
because
everyone
else
was
doing
the
same
in
fact
many
of
thepeople
who
have
gotten
or
are
getting
into
real
estate
are
the
ones
that
got
killed
by
the
stock
market
during
the
crash
consequently
these
will
probably
be
the
same
people
that
get
burned
when
the
global
housing
bubble
bursts
prices
in
australia
and
britain
are
already
sliding
america
s
housing
market
may
be
a
year
or
so
