national
of
your

who
used
to
work
with
zenon
oil
company
here
in
west
africa
herein
after
shall
be
referred
to
as
my
client
my
client
with
his
entire
family
the
wife
and
children
were
involved
in
the
explosion
in
lagos
west
africa
on
january
which
claimed
many
lives
and
property
unfortunately
my
client
and
the
family
lost
their
lives
in
that
disaster
that
needed
not
to
have
happened
since
then
i
have
made
several
enquiries
to
your
embassy
to
locate
any
of
my
clients
extended
relatives
this
has
also
proved
unsuccessful
after
these
several
unsuccessful
attempts
i
decided
to
trace
his
relatives
over
the
internet
to
locate
any
member
of
his
family
but
of
no
avail
hence
i
contacted
you
my
purpose
of
contacting
you
is
to
assist
in
repatriating
the
money

get
confiscated

the
bank

this
huge
deposits
were
lodged

unclaimed
for
over
a
period
of
years
and
few
months
without

claimed
the
said
deposit
will
be
confiscated
and
this
will
happen
with
some
couple
of
official
working
months
if
nobody
comes
for
the
money
the
company
had
issued
me
a
notice
to
provide
the
next
of
kin
or
have
the
account
confiscated
since
i
have
been
unsuccessful
in

the
relatives
for
over
two
years
now
i

your
consent
to
present
you

of
kin
