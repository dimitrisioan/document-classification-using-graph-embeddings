overview
global
diversified
industries
operates
in
the
modular
building
construction
industry
and
strategically
targets
the
california
education
sector
gdvi
is
strategically
located
in
central
california
on
acres
with
a
square
foot
state
of
the
art
manufacturing
facility
throughout
and
the
company
focused
on
building
its
infrastructure
through
acquisitions
development
of
a
state
of
the
art
manufacturing
facility
and
by
securing
the
requisite
financing
facilities
to
fuel
business
growth
through
the
combination
of
its
new
facility
million
capacity
the
increased
demand
for
portable
buildings
and
the
state
of
california
s
bond
approvals
gdvi
has
become
well
positioned
to
become
one
of
the
dominant
leaders
in
modular
manufacturing
on
the
west
coast
gdvi
should
benefit
greatly
from
the
billion
school
improvement
bond
that
is
expected
to
be
passed
by
california
voters
next
month
march
this
presents
in
our
opinion
an
opportunity
for
early
investors
of
gdvi
to
also
benefit
before
the
mainstream
investor
realizes
who
the
benefactors
are
and
subsequently
invests
in
those
companies
global
diversified
has
taken
numerous
strategic
development
steps
throughout
and
including
generating
strong
revenues
as
well
as
profits
and
is
now
poised
for
explosive
growth
in
the
company
is
led
by
a
strong
management
team
with
previous
success
in
building
companies
into
million
per
annum
businesses
in
the
past
year
gdvi
has
exceeded
its
own
sales
revenue
projections
renewed
its
piggyback
contract
received
state
approvals
on
engineered
product
designs
started
a
new
credit
facility
and
opened
its
new
square
foot
manufacturing
facility
the
company
will
continue
to
seek
new
acquisition
candidates
through
its
aggressive
growth
plan
profile
gdvi
is
a
holding
company
that
currently
operates
two
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
mbs
construction
inc
a
modular
contractor
specializing
in
modular
construction
site
work
and
renovation
and
global
modular
inc
a
sales
marketing
and
manufacturing
of
modular
type
structures
its
principal
customer
base
is
currently
educational
public
and
private
schools
universities
etc
child
care
and
municipality
sectors
its
product
lines
consist
of
a
variety
of
portable
classroom
designs
including
both
single
story
and
two
story
floor
plans
global
modular
s
portable
classroom
structures
are
engineered
and
constructed
in
accordance
with
pre
approved
building
plans
commonly
referred
to
as
p
c
s
or
pre
checked
plans
that
conform
to
structural
and
seismic
safety
specifications
administered
by
the
california
department
of
state
architects
dsa
global
modular
also
enjoys
the
benefit
of
providing
educational
customers
with
products
contracted
under
a
piggyback
clause
the
state
of
california
allows
school
districts
to
canvass
proposals
from
modular
classroom
vendors
under
a
bidding
process
where
the
successful
bidder
can
provide
other
public
school
districts
and
municipalities
portable
classrooms
under
a
piggyback
contract
issued
by
the
originating
school
district
this
process
saves
school
districts
valuable
time
and
resources
from
the
necessity
of
soliciting
bids
a
modular
vendor
who
possesses
a
piggyback
contract
containing
competitive
pricing
and
a
variety
of
design
options
may
have
access
to
future
business
for
up
to
five
years
depending
on
the
term
of
the
piggyback
contract
the
strategic
focus
on
california
schools
since
california
legislation
has
required
that
at
least
of
all
new
classrooms
constructed
with
state
funds
be
portable
structures
there
are
five
compelling
reasons
for
this
trend
modular
classrooms
are
faster
to
construct
as
quickly
as
weeks
they
cost
significantly
less
as
low
as
vs
they
offer
greater
flexibility
for
use
compared
to
conventional
buildings
they
are
easier
to
finance
they
provide
financing
incentives
to
cope
with
population
growth
the
state
department
of
education
estimates
that
california
will
need
more
than
classrooms
each
year
for
the
next
four
years
which
equates
to
more
than
classrooms
due
to
the
current
and
projected
budget
cuts
throughout
the
california
education
sector
public
and
private
schools
are
expected
to
turn
to
portable
modular
construction
to
fulfill
their
additional
classroom
requirements
over
the
next
four
years
the
california
schools
budget
crisis
on
november
a
billion
school
facilities
improvements
bond
proposal
proposition
was
passed
by
california
voters
this
bond
measure
passage
does
not
include
an
approximate
billion
worth
of
local
bond
measures
passed
by
various
school
districts
throughout
the
state
a
second
bond
measure
worth
billion
went
before
the
voters
on
the
march
these
bond
measures
are
about
three
times
higher
than
the
record
billion
bond
california
voters
approved
in
the
revenue
generated
from
these
bond
measures
will
be
used
for
school
modernization
programs
which
include
requirements
for
relocatable
classrooms
and
modular
classroom
construction
and
renovations
money
