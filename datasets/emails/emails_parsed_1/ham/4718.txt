natural
gas
demand
in
mexico
in
the
coming
years
could
grow
by
up
to
annually
such
demand
could
lead
to
natural
gas
imports
approaching
bcf
per
day
according
to
government
forecasts
in
response
pemex
proposes
two
actions
the
first
consists
of
measures
to
increase
cross
border
pipeline
infrastructure
and
capacity
such
as
a
new
pipeline
being
built
by
coral
energy
into
pemex
s
supply
hub
at
reynosa
the
possibility
of
a
new
pipeline
to
monterrey
is
still
an
option
a
second
measure
is
to
implement
a
gas
centric
exploration
and
production
program
focused
on
five
areas
two
of
which
are
dry
natural
gas
basins
burgos
and
macuspana
this
second
measure
is
intended
to
reduce
projected
imports
by
up
to
at
present
pemex
s
year
strategic
plan
does
not
contemplate
a
role
for
private
production
companies
in
capacities
other
than
that

technical
