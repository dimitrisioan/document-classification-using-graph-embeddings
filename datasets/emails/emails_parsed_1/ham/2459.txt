michael
i
have
got
csfb
working
on
the
amendment
you
asked
for
in
the
meantime
we
have
produced
a
graph
which
shows
as
indices
market
values
of
the
water
companies
and
the
rab
of
the
industry
since
privatisation
the
following
points
come
out
market
values
overtime
have
been
x
rab
the
result
is
significantly
skewed
by
the
period
between
mid
and
end
when
the
ratio
was
cl
x
the
premium
to
rab
is
only
found
at
a
time
when
political
uncertainty
has
been
removed
the
companies
are
able
to
outperform
the
regulatory
deal
significantly
those
days
are
gone
a
fact
witnessed
by
the
decline
in
share
prices
in
the
last
year
just
to
note
that
the
graph
we
have
produced
here
is
a
weighted
average
of
water
companies
whereas
the
figures
we
did
yesterday
on
the
rab
market
value
ratio
is
a
straight
average
obviously
that
influences
the
numbers
a
little
on
customerco
csfb
have
contacted
around
energy
companies
the
result
has
been
positive
and
they
are
prepared
to
enter
our
journal
exercise
i
await
a
revised
fee
proposal
but
csfb
have
been
advised
that
it
should
be
more
modest
than
the
