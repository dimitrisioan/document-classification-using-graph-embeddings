bob
i
ve
edited
our
numbers
a
bit
on
the
azurix
analysis
and
would
like
you
to
re
run
the
joint
probabilities
tables
please
note
that
i
ve
got
cases
in
the
model
now
an
optimistic
case
and
a
pessimistic
case
i
hope
you
can
run
both
cases
you
will
need
to
toggle
for
case
or
real
complicated
stuff
please
keep
everything
else
the
same
