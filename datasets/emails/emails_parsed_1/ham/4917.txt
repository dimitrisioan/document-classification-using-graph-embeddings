i
met
with
bob
today
and
discussed
the
deal
structure
we
put
together
on
the
mark
to
market
issue
bob
and
his
colleague
wess
told
me
that
as
long
as
payments
are
tied
to
one
particular
plant
we
can
not
m
t
m
them
they
had
same
problem
with
plants
here
in
the
us
like
the
peaking
plants
and
they
had
to
separate
the
plant
from
power
sales
to
be
able
to
m
t
m
the
assocated
cashflows
what
they
did
is
they
sold
power
from
the
plant
to
an
outside
party
and
bought
it
back
from
them
at
completely
different
multiple
locations
the
buyback
is
not
tied
to
any
specific
plant
and
is
marked
to
maket
even
if
enron
can
somehow
mark
to
market
a
deal
with
dpc
it
can
do
so
for
only
of
the
cashflows
because
only
of
dpc
is
owned
by
outsiders
and
a
simple
loan
to
an
affiliate
can
not
also
be
marked
to
market
bob
was
suggesting
that
if
eipl
buys
options
from
dpc
and
from
some
other
plants
and
in
turn
sells
power
to
ap
or
karnataka
then
we
could
have
a
case
for
m
t
m
politically
dpc
selling
power
to
eipl
may
not
be
the
best
solution
to
put
it
rather
mildly
our
alternatives
as
i
see
them
are
do
the
deal
as
we
structured
it
the
only
difference
is
that
enron
doesn
t
mark
it
to
market
and
income
is
earned
only
in
do
the
deal
as
we
structured
it
eipl
enron
then
sells
the
contract
to
another
party
at
a
profit
the
problem
of
course
is
finding
this
party
and
forking
part
of
the
profit
to
them
same
deal
except
revenue
securitization
is
done
through
an
outside
party
in
india
not
eipl
bob
said
he
will
think
about
the
issues
some
more
this
week
let
me
know
when
you
will
be
here
next
week
so
we
can
meet
with
bob
together
i

bob
i
wanted
to
continue
the
analysis
on
mark
to
market
that
i
had
spoken
to
you
about
on
the
phone
i
thought
that
it
was
getting
very
difficult
explaining
the
whole
transaction
by
phone
so
i
am
having
krishnarao
who
is
in
vince
s
group
explain
the
transaction
to
you
krishna
has
been
helping
us
structure
the
deal
here
in
india
and
he
has
just
returned
to
houston
from
india
after
working
with
the
team
here
he
will
seek
an
appointment
with
you
to
explain
the
transaction
i
would
like
you
to
please
spend
some
time
with
him
and
then
based
on
the
discussion
please
send
us
a
note
detailing
how
sucha
a
transaction
would
be
marked
to
market
please
cosider
the
fact
that
currently
there
are
no
such
transactions
from
the
indian
side
this
is
a
very
important
transaction
for
us
and
we
may
need
to
repeat
this
in
coming
months
hence
setting
up
the
system
to
account
for
these
maybe
well
worth
it
also
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
that
there
will
be
an
enron
india
eipl
account
in
india
based
on
indian
gaap
and
upon
consolidation
there
will
be
a
us
gaap
accounting
in
the
us
it
is
here
that
we
would
like
to
have
mark
to
market
accounting
eipl
is
structured
through
mauritius
and
then
caymen
islands
another
key
question
to
consider
is
that
when
we
m
t
m
the
transaction
in
the
us
there
will
be
a
tax
accruing
in
the
year
of
m
t
m
say
however
in
india
as
a
result
of
the
accrual
accounting
there
will
not
be
any
income
showing
till
the
year
or
we
will
need
to
know
how
that
would
get
treated
and
whether
there
is
a
way
to
get
credit
for
the
tax
payable
in
the
us
i
am
also
confused
about
whether
us
tax
would
be
levied
since
none
of
the
income
is
being
brought
back
into
the
us
remains
overseas
subpart
f
and
other
concerns
finally
we
have
been
working
hard
in
structuring
a
fixed
price
contract
and
getting
a
fixed
for
floating
swap
in
the
us
this
is
still
not
allowed
to
indian
corporates
i
need
you
to
think
about
this
too
and
see
if
some
type
of
accounting
will
solve
this
issue
krishna
knows
what
i
am
talking
about
and
will
brief
you
on
the
same
krishna
please
walk
bob
through
the
three
structures
we
had
worked
here
look
forward
to
your
help
and
comments
this
is
going
to
be
an
exciting
project
for
us
all
regards
sandeep
