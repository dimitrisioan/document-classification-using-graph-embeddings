this
note
is
from
ted
murphy
not
bjorn
hagelman
my
understanding
is
that
yet
another
meeting
has
been
scheduled
with
the
intent
of
diverting
resources
from
the
grms
project
to
some
other
project
while
i
am
not
privy
to
the
urgency
of
this
other
project
i
do
know
that
we
have
a
very
large
multi
phase
project
going
in
grms
grms
stands
for
the
global
risk
monitoring
system
it
is
not
intended
to
be
a
commercial
trading
product
not
is
its
primary
purpose
for
commercial
decision
making
conceptually
it
is
a
risk
warehouse
for
the
primary
purpose
of
rac
due
to
the
deficiency
of
current
front
office
trading
systems
and
their
inability
to
provide
timely
aggregated
information
useful
to
rac
rac
has
spent
over
a
year
developing
a
business
plan
scope
and
detailed
task
list
to
accomplish
its
objectives
as
a
firm
we
are
woefully
behind
our
press
clippings
in
our
ability
to
aggregate
and
understand
our
risk
profile
my
most
recent
sojorn
in
europe
is
a
classic
example
of
the
current
systems
inabilty
to
aggregate
and
meet
the
needs
of
rac
having
abetted
poor
decision
making
and
causing
cash
losses
in
well
in
excess
of
the
grms
budget
or
that
of
the
market
risk
group
in
rac
the
grms
project
is
a
requirement
that
bill
bradford
and
i
have
in
order
to
do
our
jobs
we
have
delegated
authority
to
debbie
brackett
and
rudi
zipter
to
make
decisions
regarding
priorities
and
as
such
meet
regularly
with
jonathon
and
his
team
as
well
as
rick
buy
to
provide
updates
while
progress
is
never
as
fast
as
we
would
like
it
in
every
instance
in
which
we
have
only
to
rely
on
rac
jonathon
s
team
and
research
to
make
a
deadline
it
haas
been
hit
the
primary
reason
for
any
delays
whatsoever
has
been
the
diversion
of
resources
off
the
project
or
the
reliance
for
cooperation
from
some
other
source
most
recently
the
it
staff
in
london
was
a
tremendous
impediment
to
deadlines
please
excuse
the
frustration
that
is
apparently
coming
through
in
this
note
but
i
feel
like
the
boy
with
his
finger
in
the
dyke
and
no
one
is
listening
also
i
have
had
several
employees
come
to
resignation
over
their
frustration
on
the
lack
of
management
support
for
this
project
usually
manifesting
itself
in
the
lack
of
resources
or
the
diversion
of
resources
devoted
to
it
i
think
we
have
proven
collectively
that
we
can
organize
a
modular
multiphase
project
and
provide
tangible
deliverables
when
not
distracted
please
let
us
do
our
jobs
i
do
not
denigrate
the
efforts
of
others
but
i
believe
that
they
must
either
submit
their
detailed
requirements
to
us
for
our
consideration
of
their
worthiness
to
put
in
our
que
or
develop
their
own
project
with
their
own
resources
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
opinion
as
it
relates
to
things
that
will
effect
the
ability
of
market
risk
to
do
its
job
please
consult
me
as
i
would
you
