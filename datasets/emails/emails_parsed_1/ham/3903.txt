found
in

update
of
its
annual
e
p
survey
the
companies
we
surveyed
are
planning
on
an
percent
increase
versus
a

budgeted
in

said
james

crandell
who
follows
oil
services
and
drilling
for
the
new
york
investment
banker
he
emphasized
that
the
gain
by
the
producers
in
lehman
s
survey
reflects
increases
in
budgets
for
and
not
underspending
of
budgets
during
among
the
companies
that
were
included
in
our
december
and
may
surveys
global
spending
actually
came
in
slightly
above
what
was
estimated
to
have
been
spent
during
in
december
it
also
indicates
that
nearly
billion
has
been
added
to
worldwide
exploration
budgets
since
december
crandell
said
the

respondents
said
that
they
planned
to
increase
u
s
e
p
expenditures
by
percent
up
from
percent
earlier
in
the
year
crandell
said
that
the
greater
increase
was
driven
almost
entirely
by
independent
producers
in
our
survey
independents
indicated
e
p
spending
growth
in
of
percent
versus
a
percent
increase
budgeted
for
the
year
in
december
he
indicated
some
percent
of
the
independents
we
surveyed
have
increased
their
u
s
e
p
budgets
while
about
percent
plan
on
spending
less
than
what
they
indicated
last
december
higher
natural
gas
prices
and
increased
cash
flow
are
the
main
drivers

raised

in
response
to
higher

prices
and
increased
cash
flow
according
to
the
lehman
analyst
he
said
that
foreign
upstream
budgets
were
an
area
of
surprise
the
percent
gain
indicated
by
the
oil
and
gas
companies
that
have
operations
outside
the
united
states
and
canada
was
well
above
the
percent
increase
for
estimated
last
december
as
in
other
geographies
there
were
more
companies
that
increased
budgets
than
decreased
them
overall
crandell
said
that
percent
of
the
surveyed
companies
raised
their
e
p
budgets
by
more
than
percent
estimated
expenditures
in
roughly
the
same
range
and
percent
indicated
that
they
would
spend
less
than
originally
planned
he
said
that
the
larger
increases
were
driven
by
some
big
companies
which
materially
increased
their
budgets
including
texaco
petroleos
brasileiros
s
a
petroleos
mexicanos
s
a
and
repsol
ypf
s
a
nyse
rep
among
the
multinationals
and
amerada
hess
apache
premier
oil
plc
and
woodside
energy
among
mid
sized
companies
crandell
noted
that
while
respondents
average
price
assumptions
rose
during
s
first
six
months
to
from
per
barrel
of
crude
oil
and
to
from
per
thousand
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
they
still
trail
current
prices
and
what
lehman
brothers
estimates
for
the
year
per
barrel
of
crude
and
per
mcf
of
gas
this
suggests
a
stronger
second
half
than
expected
should
companies
raise
budgets
further
to
reflect
the
higher
prices
