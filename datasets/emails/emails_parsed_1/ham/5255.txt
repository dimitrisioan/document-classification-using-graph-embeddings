dear
vince
back
in
july
when
you
visited
our
sydney
office
you
mentioned
extreme
value
theory
i
am
wondering
whether
research
is
looking
into
the
application
of
extreme
value
theory
to
power
and
esp
to
weather
in
a
recent
news
article
it
was
highlighted
that
a
trend
in
the
industry
towards
t
max
t
min
etc
i
am
in
particular
referring
to
the
news
article
below
in
the
past
we
have
observed
a
similar
trend
where
customers
are
asking
for
t
max
t
min
or
below
or
above
precipitation
structures
the
choice
in
the
past
has
been
the
burn
analysis
on
historical
data
however
we
are
in
particular
interested
in
the
extreme
events
and
the
application
of
evt
could
provide
a
meaningful
tool
for
the
analysis
has
the
research
group
looked
into
the
application
of
evt
to
weather
evt
has
a
long
history
of
application
in
hydrology
which
would
cover
parts
of
the
precipitation
structures
also
research
esp
at
eth
in
zuerich
is
indicating
the
application
of
evt
to
v
r
thank
you
regards
christian
