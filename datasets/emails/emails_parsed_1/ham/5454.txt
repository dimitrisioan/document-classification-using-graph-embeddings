would
be
able
to
bring
our
participants
for
a
tour
of
your
trading

time
we

have
people
and
since
only

maximum

be
on
a
trading
floor
we
need
to
have
companies
among
which
to
divide
our
participants
at
this
time
we
have
a
floor
from
coral
energy
and
are
working
with
duke
and
i
will
be
contacting
mr

the
reliant
energy
trading
floor
i
was
hoping
very
much
that
you
would
be
able
to
direct
me
to
the
right
person
to
contact
to
arrange
this
tour
will

be
a
possiblity
