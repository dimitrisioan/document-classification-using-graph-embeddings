rollover
of
my
vacation
days
to
vince
i
would
like
to
rollover
my
vacation
days
for
remaining
at
the
end
of
this
year
to
i
could
not
use
us
all
of
my
available
vacation
this
year
because
of
the
following
reasons
as
you
know
i
have
been
supporting
three
business
units
ees
epg
enron
india
this
year
all
these
units
had
difficult
and
relatively
long
projects
that
required
experience
in
energy
markets
derivatives
pricing
and
business
knowledge
that
i
had
gained
over
the
last
few
years
at
enron
there
has
been
a
significant
change
in
the
team
members
reporting
to
me
i
now
have
six
people
under
me
compared
to
only
three
at
the
begin
of
the
year
of
the
current
six
members
five
joined
us
only
this
year
and
most
of
them
didn
t
have
any
prior
work
experience
thus
requiring
a
lot
of
my
time
in
recruiting
training
and
mentoring
given
that
i
had
to
visit
our
bombay
office
in
january
for
a
business
trip
days
and
will
need
to
go
there
again
in
january
i
could
not
take
leave
from
my
work
for
the
other
two
units
ees
epg
for
an
extended
period
of
time
so
in
summary
this
year
has
been
a
long
and
challenging
one
and
as
a
result
i
could
not
take
vacation
for
more
than
a
few
days
i
request
you
to
grant
the
rollover
of
my
remaining
vacation
to
next
year
currently
i
have
hours
of
vacation
available
and
of
these
i
expect
to
have
hours
unused
at
the
end
of
this
year
thank
you
krishna
