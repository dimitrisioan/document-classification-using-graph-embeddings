dear
garp
speaker
this
is
just
a
quick
note
to
keep
you
up
to
date
with
developments
at
the
garp
convention
which
will
be
held
in
new
york
between
th
and
th
february
thus
far
garp
looks
set
to
far
exceed
our
expectations
and
garp
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
convention
delegate
bookings
have
been
much
higher
than
this
time
last
year
as
a
result
we
are
set
to
far
exceed
the
number
of
delegates
that
attention
earlier
this
year
the
three
workshops
and
the
one
day
asset
management
forum
are
also
very
well
received
and
will
probably
reach
full
capacity
i
will
of
course
provide
you
with
much
fuller
details
closer
to
the
time
of
the
event

the
event
itself
i
would
like
a
few
outstanding
issues
presentations
can
you
please
e
mail
your
presentation
to
me
by
th
december
so
that
i
have
enough
time
to
reproduce
them
and
place
them
in
a
delegate
pack
for
the
convention
given
the
break
of
the
christmas
and
new
york
period
and
that
the
event
is
being
held
in
new
york
i
am
sure
you
can
appreciate
that
there
are
certain
logistical
factors
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
hence
the
reason
why
the
presentations
are
required
as
soon
as
possible

is
purely
for
reproduction
