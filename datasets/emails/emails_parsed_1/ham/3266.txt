visit
from
stanford
dear
dr
kaminski
let
me
briefly
introduce
myself
i
am
the
director
of
corporate
relations
for
the
school
of
engineering
at
stanford
university
in
this
role
i
am
always
on
the
watch
for
ways
to
bring
our
faculty
together
with
companies
that
have
an
appetite
for
engagement
with
top
tier
research
institutions
i
believe
you
know
hill
huntington
who
is
a
senior
researcher
with
stanford
s
energy
modeling
forum
he
suggested
i
get
in
touch
with
you
for
some
ideas
about
contacts
at
enron
i
m
in
the
process
of
planning
a
trip
to
texas
in
early
may
along
with
my
colleague
donna
lawrence
the
university
s
director
of
corporate
relations
we
were
hoping
to
be
able
to
include
a
stop
at
enron
on
our
itinerary
right
now
it
appears
that
friday
may
th
would
work
best
for
us
but
we
re
at
the
very
beginning
of
our
trip
planning
the
purpose
of
our
visit
would
be
to
review
the
current
relationship
between
enron
and
stanford
to
give
you
an
overview
of
current
priorities
in
the
school
of
engineering
and
ask
for
your
help
in
identifying
the
best
points
of
contact
i
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
about
your
availability
sincerely
