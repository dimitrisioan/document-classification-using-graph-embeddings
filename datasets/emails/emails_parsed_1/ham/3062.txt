recruiting
for
weather
risk
management
group
dear
vince
and
christie
i
hope
that
you
are
both
well
and
are
ready
for
the
onset
of
summer
in
houston
i
was
disappointed
that
i
was
not
able
to
see
you
at
the
final
tiger
team
presentations
last
month
due
to
a
family
emergency
i
hope
that
the
teams
analyses
will
be
helpful
to
your
work
and
echo
their
appreciation
of
your
involvement
and
support
i
am
writing
with
a
question
regarding
recruiting
for
enron
s
weather
risk
management
group
my
boyfriend
greg
hunt
is
currently
seeking
opportunities
to
combine
his
background
in
meteorology
ms
and
years
of
research
at
lawrence
livermore
nat
l
lab
and
an
mba
in
finance
and
information
technology
i
began
thinking
about
enron
s
work
in
weather
derivatives
and
realized
that
there
could
possibly
be
a
great
fit
there
i
have
copied
greg
on
this
message
and
would
appreciate
any
suggestions
you
can
offer
regarding
opportunities
in
this
group
thank
you
