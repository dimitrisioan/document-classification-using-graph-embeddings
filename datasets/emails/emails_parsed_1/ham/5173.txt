re
factor
loadings
for
primary
curves
tanya
i
went
through
the
comparisons
for
the
liquids
curves
and
the
appearance
of
clear
parallel
shifts
etc
do
begin
to
emerge
when
fewer
forward
prices
are
used
it
looks
sensible
i
have
passed
the
graphs
over
to
the
liquids
people
and
i
have
asked
them
to
identify
rough
term
structure
months
when
illiquidity
begins
for
these
curves
it
might
coincide
with
your
assumptions
i
am
surprised
by
brent
and
dubai
which
should
be
wti

naveen
vlady
jin
yu
finished
debugging
the
vatrfacs
code
and
now
it
calculates
factor
loadings
for
every
primary
curve
except
power
curves
i
am
sending
you
the
calculated
factors
most
of
them
don
t
look
good
forward
prices
were
used
in
calculations
for
each
commodity
i
reran
the
code
using
fewer
forward
prices
depending
on
the
commodity
prices
for
c
gc
mtbe
nc
so
prices
for
nxho
for
sa
for
c
gc
lax
jfk
for
condensate
dubaicrude
brent
for
nsw
semichem
risi
these
results
are
in
most
of
them
look
much
better
please
review
we
will
have
to
add
a
column
in
rms
main
curve
list
to
specify
how
many
forward
prices
we
want
to
use
for
each
commodity
and
then
use
the
new
factors
in
the
var
model
