sorry
i
shall
miss
you
on
thursday
i
shall
definitely
attend
you
presentation
at
power
i
shall
ask
about
a
guest
accounton
eol
typically
such
an
account
allows
an
outside
user
to
take
a
look
at
the
system
but
i
don
t
think
the
traders
will
allow
systematic
access
to
the
price
data
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
a
third
