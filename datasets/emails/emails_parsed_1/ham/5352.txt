re
var
calibration
issues
we
are
proposing
the
following
changes
to
the
calculation
of
ng
correlations
weight
the
data
set
calendar
months
used
in
calculating
correlations
most
recent
data
weighed
heavier
use
respective
contract
prices
instead
of
prompt
month
prices
i
e
for
nov
correlations
use
nov
contract
prices
for
the
last
months
as
opposed
to
prompt
month
prices
for
the
last
three
months
tanya
i
have
confirmed
with
ted
and
he
gave
us
green
light
to
make
both
changes
did
we
get
an
opinion
from
vince
winston
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
changes
apply
to
ng
correlations
only
not
the
correlations
between
commodities
we
will
test
the
changes
in
gas
and
then
decide
on
world
wide
implementation
any
estimate
on
timing
of
this
implementation
cassandra
ted
suggested
that
you
and
veronica
should
document
this
as
a
change
in
var
parameters
and
inform
all
commercial
desk
heads
of
these
changes
we
intend
to
make
them
for
na
gas
first
but
ultimately
make
these
changes
consistent
across
all
commodity
groups
let
me
know
if
you
have
questions
thanks

vlady
also
in
the
meeting
we
identified
that
there
are
still
some
issures
regarding
to
the
correlation
matrix
calculations
since
different
commodity
has
different
expiration
dates
when
calculate
correlation
between
two
commodities
the
two
may
have
different
prompt
months
are
we
going
to
use
prices
on
two
different
prompt
months
or
are
we
going
to
use
the
prices
on
the
same
month
disregarding
prompt
months
because
above
issues
jin
is
not
going
do
any
changes
on
the
correlation
matrix
calculation
until
above
issures
can
be
solved

re

issues
vlady
we
met
with
winston
and
jin
today
regarding
var
calibration
issues
the
outcome
on
this
discussion
is
jin
will
put
weights
into
calculation
of
factor
loadings
jin
will
change
the
way
factor
loading
are
calculated
for
each
commodity
the
prompt
month
contract
will
be
selected
for
the
effective
date
of
vatrfacs
run
then
the
historical
prices
will
be
collected
for
month
for
all
forward
contracts
starting
from
selected
prompt
month
contract
the
variance
covariance
matrix
will
be
calculated
based
on
these
data
it
will
be
converted
into
correlation
matrix
then
factor
loadings
analysis
will
be
performed
on
the
correlation
matrix
