re
anjam
s
term
sheet
tara
i
am
forwarding
it
to
vince
for
his
approval
it
looks
good
although
i
have
three
questions
i
presume
that
it
is
clear
that
enron
pays
housing
up
to
month
anjam
does
not
get
a
check
for
to
play
with
utility
bills
are
not
included
unless
part
of
the
rent
right
this
should
be
clarified
as
you
know
houston
summers
are
a
significant
burden
on
the
pocket
book
economy
class
plane
can
we
even
do
that
i
thought
enron
policy
was
for
a
b
class
ticket
for
flights
over
hours
lbs
of
transport
i
don
t
know
if
this
is
a
big
ticket
item
but
i
would
give
him
less
say
if
it
would
save
enron
considerable
expense
regards
grant
