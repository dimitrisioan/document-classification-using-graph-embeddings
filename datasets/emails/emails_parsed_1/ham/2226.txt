i
am
forwarding
an
analysis
put
together
by
sandeep
kohli
and
reviewed
by
vince
and
me
the
results
in
the
attached
word
document
show
that
dabhol
energy
costs
are
several
cents
below
that
of
roughly
mw
of
distributed
generation
which
has
been
identified
in
maharastra
this
mw
does
not
include
innumerable
small
generators
which
will
have
even
worse
energy
costs
the
excel
spreadsheet
contains

data
and

please
find
the
two
attachments
that
give
a
more
detailed
calculation
as
well
as
the
revised
statement
that
can
be
made
to
press
the
numbers
are
not
small
but
really
do
not
reflect
the
true
magnitude
of
the
genset
issue
they
do
not
take
into
account
the
capital
costs
of
the
gensets
and
also
do
not
focus
on
the
many
smaller
units
that
are
operating
in
homes
and
commercial
establishments
hope
ths
helps
regards
sandeep
