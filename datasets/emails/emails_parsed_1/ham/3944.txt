re
vol
rollup
john
we
can
approach
this
problem
this
way
basically
you
are
asking
how
the
total
variance
are
distributed
among
days
and
the
last
days
assuming
volatility
for
the
first
period
is
simgal
and
that
in
the
last
days
is
sigma
then
sigmal
sigma
futhermore
we
can
use
nov
implied
volatility
as
a
proxy
to
sigmal
then
we
can
calculate
sigma
which
is
the
volatility
for
dec
contract
in
the
last
days
sigam
sqrt
sigmal
make
sense

i
am
trying
to
understand
what
the
near
winter
ng
implied
vols
will
look
like
as
they
approach
expiration
for
example
is
it
possible
to
infer
what
the
implied
volatility
of
the
deco
ng
contract
will
look
like
with
days
to
expiry
given
we
know
current
vol
and
term
to
maturity
days
