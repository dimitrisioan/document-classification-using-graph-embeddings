trucking
ceos
say
they
haven
t
seen
this
slow
a
first
quarter
in
a
decade
perhaps
the
weakest
first
quarter
for
freight
demand
since

swift
transportation
chairman
and
ceo
jerry
moyes
said
the
first
quarter
trucking
mantra
historically
has
been
this
everybody
loses
money
in
january
hopes
for
a
break
even
february
and
earns
whatever
profit
there
is
in
the
quarter
in
march
that
formula
may
not
hold
this

gregory

quesnel
president

said
the
current
slowdown
was
first
detected
late
in
the
third
quarter
last
year
and
has
become
more
pronounced
in
each
successive
quarter
march
he
said
has
been
as
disappointing
as
the
first
two
months
this
year
layoffs
already
are
occurring
at
the
major
ltl
carriers
yellow
freight
system
has
idled
as
many
as
teamsters
and
hundreds
of
white

back
office
workers
most
large
carriers
are
warning
of
profit
shortfalls
that
will
cause
them
to
miss
analysts
first
quarter
estimates
but
there
are
deeper
fears
too
marginal
players
may
be
forced
into
bankruptcy
small
family
owned
carriers
may
be
unable
to
exit
the
industry
on
their
own
terms
because
of
the
shocking
decline
in
the
value
of
used
trucks
that
is
causing
some
companies
to
be
valued
at
less
than
half
their
worth
of
just
two
years
ago
swift
s
volume
drop
off
began
with
shipments
originating
on
the
west
coast
in
january
and
february
and
it
is
continuing
in
march
moyes
said
coupled
with
reduced
demand
from
the
southwest
moyes
said
swift
will
not
meet
analysts
first
quarter
earnings
expectations
swift
is
not
alone
we
hauled
less
freight
in
february
than
february
a

the

said
freight
figures
were
flat
in
february
year
over

but
rose
slightly
in
march
overnite
is
the
exception
to
the
ltl
industry
with
as
many
as
new
terminals
scheduled
to
be
opened
this
year
january
was
pretty
good
to
us
but
february
was
flat
it
s
coming
back
in
march
we
re
probably
up
in
low
single
digits
to
percent
we
re
picking
back
up
the
economy
has
hurt
us
if
you
had
asked
us
at
the
start
of
the
year
we
d
have
said
we
d
be
up
double
digits
hanley
said
the
national
economic
picture
is
a
big
concern
hanley
said
we
re
not
seeing
pressure
on
prices
at
least
not
so
far
we
re
seeing
customers
ship
pallets
a
day
instead
of
the
shipment
size
is
coming
down
certainly
we
re
concerned
we
ll
do
o

but
not
as
great
as

board
chairman

the
genuine
leading
indicator
of
any
national
economic

is
trucking
which
is
always
a
first
in

in
any

shippers
see
what
s
happening
as
well
but
say
it
s
still
too
early
in
the

for

to
start
cutting
rates
to
fill

all
the

we

irving
texas
with
a

of

carriers
we

no

for

in
the
next
few
months
we
are
getting
feelers
about
some
possible
lane
adjustments
to
boost
revenue
but
generally
it
appears
a
little
early
in
the
economic
downturn
for
much
price
movement
the
national
ltl
carriers
are
seeing
the
same
things
our
business
is
down
pretty
substantially
for
the

citing
what
it
called
the

serious
economic
slowdown
said
it
expects
first

earnings
to
fall
very
substantially
below
current
wall
street
consensus
extreme

also
contributed
to
the
already

usf

samuel

skinner
added
traditionally
the
first
quarter
builds
momentum
slowly
with
march
being
the
strongest
month
of
the
period
skinner
said
in
a
statement
this
year
the
economic
slowdown
of
the
fourth
quarter
of
accelerated
in
january
and
february
softening
even
the
normal
modest
expectations
for
those
two
months
it
s
not
just
the
ltl
industry
that
s
hurting
the
morgan
stanley
dean
witter
truckload
freight
index
continues
to
show
the
worst
demand
supply
relationship
since
analyst
james
j
valentine
began
tracking
the
data
in
april
two
events
can
cause
weakness
in
the
index
according
to
valentine
they
are
either
an
abundance
of
excess
trucks
on
the
road
or
weak
freight
demand
so
far
in
we
have
seen
the
confluence
of
both
factors
but
the
fall
off
in
demand
has
far
outpaced
the
increase
in
supply
valentine
wrote
in
his
most
recent
trucking
snapshot
for
early
march
year
to
date
measurement
for
truckload
demand
is
down
percent
year
over
year
according
to
valentine
s
index
while
supply
is
up
only
percent
that
would
indicate
the
over
capacity
was
a
significant
issue
last
year
but
was
masked
by
the
strong
economy
valentine
says
in
a
more
ominous
note
valentine
believes
overcapacity
will
continue
to
plague
the
truckload
industry
for
the
next
one
to
two
years
only
a
reaccelerating
national
economy
can
bring
the
demand
supply
back
in
balance
for
the
truckload
sector
in
the
near
term
valentine
predicts
the
overproduction
of
new
class
trucks
from
early
through
early
last
year
has
put
too
many
trucks
on
the
roads
and
caused
supply
to
back
up
at
manufacturers
wholesalers
and
other
retailers
used
trucks
have
lost
on
average
more
than
percent
of
their
value
over
the
past
months
anecdotally
one
used
truck
dealer
music
city
truck
equipment
in
lavergne
tenn
is
holding
a
two
for
one
sale
on
three
to
five
year
old
class
freightliners
you
can
buy
two
for
around
less
than
a
brand
new
chevy
suburban
suv
what
that
means
is
a
trucker
who
bought
a
class
truck
for
and
depreciated
half
the
value
over
three
years
has
a
piece
of
equipment
on
the
books
this
year
at
but
assuming
it
has
lost
percent
of
that
value
it
may
only
be
worth
in
actuality
for
a
carrier
with
a
truck
fleet
that
equates
to
a
loss
of
more
than
million
on
assets
the
glut
may
last
for
a
while
according
to
valentine
s
analysis
assuming
a
three
year
trade
in
cycle
most
of
the
class
tractors
in
the
truckload
sector
are
just
now
rolling
over
to
the
used
truck
market
that
means
that
overcapacity
will
plague
the
truckload
industry
for
at
least
the
next
year
that
will
result
in
some
of
the
marginal
carriers
exiting
the
business
as
did
nearly
carriers
last
year
that
either
closed
or
declared
bankruptcy
we
can
see
from
indexes
surveys
and
other
information
available
to
us
that
it
is
unlikely
there
will
be
any
significant
improvement
in
march
and
freight
demands
will
continue
to
be
soft
throughout
the
month
based
on
all
of
these
factors
we
expect
usfreightways
profits
for
the
first
quarter
to
be
very
substantially
less
than
published
analysts
forecasts
skinner
said
in
addition
severe
weather
conditions
including
an
earthquake
in
seattle
rainstorms
in
california
and
blizzards
in
the
northeast
have
added
cost
and
decreased
efficiencies
skinner
added
expectations
at
each
of
usf
s
operating
companies
have
been
affected
some
more
than
others
the
ltl
logistics
reverse
logistics
and
freight
forwarding
units
are
all
showing
decreased
revenue
and
volume
over
a
similar
period
last
year
skinner
said
further
job
cuts
at
usf
worldwide
its
freight
forwarder
would
be
in
the
offing
as
cost
controls
at
the
unit
would
be
accelerated
in
the
wake
of
the
softening
economy
skinner
said
late
last
year
skinner
said
the
rebuilding
process
at
usf
worldwide
would
be
a
two
year
process
but
the
worsening
economy
has
made
that
rebuilding
job
harder
he
said
we
are
seeing
evidence
that
the
slowing
economy
is
in
fact
further
impeding
progress
in
this
area
skinner
said
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
and
continuing
into
the
first
quarter
of
the
company
has
taken
steps
to
increase
cost
efficiencies
among
these
actions
are
a
substantial
cutback
in
capital
spending
and
significant
reductions
in
the
labor
force
these
cost
control
efforts
will
be
accelerated
to
partially
counterbalance
