security
after
hours
access
tony
earl
harvey
and
i
are
located
on
the
th
floor
inside
the
corporate
research
group
s
area
which
is
in
a
secured
area
they
are
a
very
supportive
and
cooperative
group
and
conditions
here
are
ideal
for
research
analysis
and
writing
i
don
t
want
to
jeopardize
their
security
in
any
way
but
if
possible
i
would
like
to
be
added
to
the
after
hours
and
weekend
access
list
for
situations
such
as
meeting
deadlines
and
research
and
that
if
you
did
not
concur
with
my
request
then
there
would
be
no
reason
to
copy
him
at
all
thanks
