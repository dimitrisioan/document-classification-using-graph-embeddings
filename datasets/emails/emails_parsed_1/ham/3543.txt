spread
options
jeff
we
are
reviewing
the
p
spread
option
book
one
item
of
note
is
that
the
correlations
used
to
book
the
spread
options
have
dropped
significantly
from
what
was
being
used
a
year
ago
see
charts
below
i
also
remember
that
john
mee
was
using
even
higher
correlations
when
he
ran
this
book
in
fact
he
wanted
to
book
options
with
a
correlation
of
but
our
model
would
not
allow
it
so
he
was
using
we
are
currently
calculating
historical
correlations
for
you
as
well
if
you
want
vince
and
i
can
review
this
with
you
at
the
end
of
the
day
just
let
me
know
what
time
would
be
convenient
