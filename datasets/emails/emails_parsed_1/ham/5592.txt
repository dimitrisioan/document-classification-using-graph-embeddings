i
feel
i
would
benefit
from
understanding
the
monte
carlo
techniques
and
what
it
applies
to
as
well
as
when
it
is
used
these
mc
techniques
i
think
i
could
get
several
people
interested
thanks

am
no

at
the
risk

c

we
could
probably
put
together
an
internal
training
for
you
if
you
want
i
ll
bring
this
up
with
vince
at
our
staff
meeting
tomorrow
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
can
describe
for
me
the
intended
audience
and
the
types
of
applications
that
would
interest
them
