i
am
writing
about
a
student
of
mine
who
is
on
the
job
market
this
year
when
you
stopped
by
my
office
about
months
ago
you
asked
if
i
had
any
students
that
might
be
appropriate
for
your
group
although
i
didn
t
at
the
time
now
i
do
this
student
has
excellent
technical
skills
including
an
m
s
in
statistics
and
a
ph
d
in
economics
by
the
end
of
the
current
academic
year
his
dissertation
research
is
on
the
investment
behavior
of
independent
power
producers
in
the
us
as
a
result
of
research
assistance
he
has
done
for
me
he
knows
the
california
market
very
well
and
is
familiar
with
the
other
isos
i
think
he
would
be
an
excellent
match
for
you
the
only
problem
is
that
he
will
probably
have
many
other
options
available
however
i
definitely
think
he
s
worth
a
look
if
you
d
like
him
to
send
you
a
cv
please
let
me
know
thanks
