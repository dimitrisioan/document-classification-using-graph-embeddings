i
certainly
think
anjam
tanya
should
visit
ny
but
i
simply
had
a
concern
that
some
of
the
questions
being
asked
had
already
been
covered
by
anjam
myself
and
andreas
but
had
somehow
not
been
communicated
my
message
was
not
intended
to
convey
any
another
impression
i
ve
also
now
spoken
with
anjam
information
on
exotic
options
structures
existing
the
data
flow
are
we
going
to
get
data
from
london
or
ny
a
storage
of
positions
information
at
mg
how
to
extract
the
positions
info
from
mg
database
into
spreadsheets
b
existing
positions
structure
for
each
metal
introduction
to
concentrates
trading
