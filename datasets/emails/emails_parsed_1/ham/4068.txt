i
shall
be
glad
to
cover
the
cost
of
a
coffee
mug
with
our
logos
can
you
identify
a

rice
memorabilia
i
shall
run
the
design
through
our
pr
department
and
then

seminar
series
vince
i
have
checked
with
our
accounting
folks
and
it
looks
like
the
balance
in
the
seminar
account
is
under
this
will
get
us
going
in
the
fall
so
we
have
some
flexibility
for
the
next
enron
funding
whatever
works
best
on
your
end
also
i
am
interested
in
pursuing
the
idea
of
designing
some
sort
of
a
gift
a
coffee
cup
perhaps
to
give
to
our
seminar
guests
i
think
we
could
do
something
neat
with
the
enron
and
rice
jgs
logos
that
folks
would
be
happy
to
display
on
their
shelf
or
desk
top
what
do
you
think
as
always
thank
you
so
much
for
your
support
of
our
efforts
over
here
it
is
truly
appreciated
