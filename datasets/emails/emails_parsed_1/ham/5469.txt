sorry
so
much
time
has
passed
since
we
last
discussed
your
north
american
gas
model
i
am
however
still
interested
in
setting
up
a
test
process
to
familiarize
some
of
our
key
people
with
the
model
and
the
database
etc
i
am
now
reviewing
the
licensing
agreement
that
you
submitted
in
december
and
will
be
back
in
touch
soon
i
need
to
discuss
this
further
with
the
business
segments
but
i
suspect
that
our
interest
will
be
focused
more
on
the
long
term
gas
model
another
member
of
your
firm
had
called
last
week
but
i
somehow
misplaced
his
name
and
number
i
thought
that
an
e
mail
response
would
suffice
for
now
my
apologies
regards
john
goodpasture
