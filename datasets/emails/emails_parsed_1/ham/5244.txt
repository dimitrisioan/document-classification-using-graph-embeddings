overview
a
comprehensive
reform
of
gas
legislation
in
central
and
eastern
europe
is
bringing
the
region
in
line
with
the
european
union

s
gas
directive
this
is
true
both
for
the
countries
expected
to
enter
the
union
by


czech
republic
estonia
hungary
poland
and
slovenia
and
for
candidates
whose
entry
is
not
scheduled
before
the
end
of
the
decade

s
view
current
developments
regarding
the
establishment
of
a
legal
framework
for
the
internal
gas
market
in
eastern
and
central
europe
look
promising
from
an
investor

s
point
of
view
the
candidate
countries
presented
a
review
of
progress
made
in
the
implementation
of
the
eu
gas
directive
during
a
two
day
workshop
held
by
the
european
commission
and
the
world
bank
in
paris
in
november
many
of
these
countries
have
been
reforming
their
energy
industries
throughout
the
s
as
part
of
their
transition
to
a
market
economy
the
results
have
been
mixed
particularly
in
the
utility
industries
the
gas
directive
adopted
in
august
now
offers
a
compelling
incentive
for
eu
candidate
countries
to
transform
their
gas
industries
while
providing
a
road
map
to
guide
them
the
critical
points
relevant
to
harmonization
between
the
european
union
and
candidate
countries
include
the
following
legal
framework
and
regulation
the
legal
framework
is
the
cornerstone
of
enlargement
and
the
yardstick
of
harmonization
in
europe
as
a
result
in
all
candidate
countries
in

energy
laws
were
either
updated
or
newly
established
along
the
principles
spelled
out
in
the
gas
directive
regulatory
bodies
have
been
created
by
law
and
are
operating
in
every
country
although
issues
of
staffing
financial
autonomy
and
independence
from
political
influence
are
not
uniformly
resolved
third
party
access
tpa
and
long
term
take
or
pay
contracts
all
candidate
countries
agree
that
tpa
is
a
key
to
market
competition
therefore
all
have
adopted
it
or
intend
to
do
so
in
their
new
legislation
although
the
commission
favors
regulated
tpa
the
specific
approaches
to
tpa
enforcement
in
the
candidate
countries
remain
unclear
in
some
cases
in
particular
the
implementation
of
tpa
will
have
to
address
the
issue
of
long
term
take
or
pay
contracts
with
russia
that
were
signed
by
all
major
domestic
gas
companies
and
somewhat
preempt
competition
russian
gas
is
for
the
most
part
sold
to
single
traditional
state
owned
operators
that
dominate
their
internal
markets
a
balance
will
need
to
be
struck
between
these
incumbent
dominant
players
and
the
competitive
environment
this
is
made
more
complicated
by
their
ownership
of
large
volumes
of
russian
gas
supplied
in
kind
in
exchange
for
transit
rights
to
west
european
customers
article
of
the
directive
provides
for
a
derogation
to
companies
experiencing
difficulties
stemming
from
take
or
pay
obligations
this
derogation
would
apply
to
the
companies
of
candidate
countries
with
historical
and
commercial
links
with
the
russian
gas
industry
furthermore
article
allows
derogations
to
those
member
states
with
only
one
major
gas
supplier
to
those
with
an


emerging
gas
market
status


or
to
those
without
a
direct
gas
connection
to
the
grid
of
another
member
state
most
of
the
candidate
countries
would
in
principle
be
able
to
call
on
one
or
more
of
these
grounds
for
derogation
when
they
join
the
european
union
price
cross
subsidies
residential
gas
tariffs
are
artificially
low
and
are
financed
partially
through
higher
rates
applied
to
industrial
consumers
in
various
countries
tariff
increases
and
the
phasing
out
of
subsidies
have
been
scheduled
but
such
decisions
remain
politically
sensitive
to
enforce
this
has
recently
been
emphasized
by
high
gas
prices
owing
to
the
linkage
of
imported
gas
to
oil
prices
all
candidate
countries
have
set
legal
frameworks
that
include
the
phasing
out
of
cross
subsidies
as
part
of
sector
reform
but
the
actual
implementation
will
remain
politically
difficult
as
table
indicates
price
rebalancing
is
already
under
way
in
most
countries
expected
to
enter
the
european
union
by
mid
decade
but
the
legal
framework
itself
can
not
guarantee
the
pace
of
reform
the
same
goes
for
candidate
countries
that
have
only
recently
introduced
eu
complying
energy
laws
and
whose
entry
to
the
european
union
is
likely
to
happen
in
a
longer
time
frame
unbundling
most
countries
understand
that
the
unbundling
of
transmission
companies
from
their
supply
businesses
is
the
second
critical
element
of
liberalization
to
date
unbundling
the
accounts
of
these
two
businesses
is
all
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
member
states
or
in
the
candidate
countries
in
the
future
the
commission
is
likely
to
press
all
eu
countries
for
legal
separation

structural
unbundling

of
the
businesses
and
candidate
countries
will
have
to
pursue
their
reform
of
the
gas
sector
accordingly
table
gives
an
overview
of
the
state
of
play
in
candidate
countries
as
the
table
shows
the
countries
belonging
to
the
second
group
have
only
very
recently
undertaken
the
reform
of
the
gas
sector
in
accordance
with
the
directive
whereas
change
had
been
introduced
earlier
in
the
countries
scheduled
for
the
