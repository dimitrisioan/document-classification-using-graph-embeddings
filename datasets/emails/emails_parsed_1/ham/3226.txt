re
analytical
var
implementation
in
risktrac
debbie
i
am
forwarding
to
you
a
page
document
describing
implementation
of
analytical
var
in
risktrac
here
is
why
this
effort
is
very
important
we
need
to
calculate
var
for
other
percentile
but
or
even
as
mentioned
by
rick
buy
and
our
simulation
model
can
not
handle
required
number
of
simulations
we
need
to
present
additional
risk
measures
such
as
mean
tail
loss
to
the
board
the
analytical
approach
is
implemented
in
a
spreadsheet
and
fully
tested
already
so
there
will
be
no
problems
with
the
algorithm
itself
we
need
to
get
together
and
discuss
it
implementation
what
do
you
think
