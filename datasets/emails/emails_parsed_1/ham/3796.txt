maureen
hope
all
is
well
thank
you
for
your
coverage
last
week
i
certainly
appreciate
the
value
added
that
you
provide
in
your
research
i
had
a
quick
question
for
you
regarding
any
anticipated
japan
central
bank
intervention
at
the
level
in
the
nikkei
if
i
am
understanding
the
mechanism
correctly
bis
reserve
requirements
fall
below
certain
threshold
and
banks
can
no
longer
lend
money
and
meet
bis
lending
criteria
due
to
improper
reserve
base
and
this
roughly
happens
at
level
reason
i
ask
is
goldman
sachs
put
out
an
article
suggesting
that
break
evenpoint
for
bank
holding
of
stocks
is
roughly
a
different
index
level
than
the
one
you
have
mentioned
i
can
appreciate
the
difference
between
reserve
liquidity
and
actual
break
even
on
equity
positions
but
just
wanted
to
clarify
this
point
with
you
as
we
are
trying
to
gain
a
complete
understanding
of
how
a
trigger
would
effect
japanese
capital
markets
and
so
as
i
currently
understand
it
there
are
trigger
levels
to
watch
where
banks
fail
bis
criteria
and
hence
can
not
extend
new
loans
with
bis
stamp
of
approval
clearly
ctl
bank
would
have
incentive
in
restoring
this
or
else
financial
system
would
be
thrown
into
turmoil
where
banks
begin
to
take
an
actual
loss
on
equity
holdings
is
this
right
thanks
maureen
take
care
