vince
thanks
for
the
quick
response
agree
on
just
bear
in
mind
it
says
scope

implement
so
it
is
more
of
a
development
of
a
project
re
mg
i
will
keep
tanya
apprised
of
travel
plans
and
give
her
the
option
to
be
in
or

see
fit

re

priorities
ted
item
will
require
help
from
it
my
understanding
is
that
currently
we
are
receiving
the
positions
aggregated
to
a
daily
level
also
i
talked
to
tanya
about
visiting
mg
in
new
york
she
is
leaving
for
vacation
on
the
th
of
july
and
can
go
for
a
day
to
nyc
prior
to
this
date
i
think
that
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
for
her
to
visit
mg
and
to
kick
the
tires
i
asked
her
to
coordinate
the
trip
with
you
it
makes
sense
for
both
of
you
to
go
together
i
may
join
you
depending
on
my
availability

below
is
a
brief
summary
of
near
term
projects
for
the
enhancement
of
var
and
the
use
of
var
as
you
can
tell
some
are
not
directly
research
issues
some
require
the
guidance
but
not
direct
work
product
and
are
very
north
american
wholesale
centric
vince
i
think
that
the
only
one
in
which
progress
requires
your
input
to
get
kick
started
is
all
others
are
in
progress
with
tanya
grant
involved
through
jeff
shankman
s
regular
meeting
we
would
like
to
get
your
input
as
to
your
priorities
we
were
thinking
top
and
then
start
knocking
some
of
them
out
it
is
not
meant
to
be
exhaustive
and
is
focused
on
fixes
as
opposed
to
overhauls

this
is
my
initial
attempt
to
summarize
our
meeting
with

the
next
steps
would
be
to
solicit
feedback
from
other
interested
parties
and
scope
the
resources
and
responsibilities
ted
rick
buy
john
lavorato
and
i
met
to
discuss
priorities
as
it
relates
to
the
calculation
of

we
are
making
the
following
recommendations

of
monthly
