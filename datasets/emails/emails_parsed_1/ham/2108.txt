oil
in
the
past
two
weeks
oil
prices
have
sold
off
the
premium
or
price
strength
that
had
been
built
into
the
market
in
anticipation
of
possible
shortages
this
winter
the
exact
cause
of
the
sharp
switch
in
market
psychology
is
hard
to
pinpoint
but
seems
to
be
a
combination
of
very
early
signs
that
the
oil
stock
situation
is
at
least
stabilizing
even
if
stocks
have
not
built
substantially
and
that
thus
far
despite
a
few
weeks
of
colder
than
normal
temperatures
heating
oil
supply
has
been
adequate
to
meet
demand
in
the
key
us
market
that
has
allayed
some
of
the
concerns
that
were
driving
speculative
interest
into
the
market
furthermore
the
potential
for
weakness
in
the
us
economy
may
be
creating
expectations
for
weaker
oil
demand
in
the
change
in
market
psychology
was
dramatically
illustrated
when
news
that
iraq
was
cutting
off
exports
caused
prices
to
slide
yet
the
iraqi
export
cutoff
is
having
a
concrete
effect
on
fundamentals
if
the
cutoff
lasts
through
december
the
effect
will
be
pronounced
it
would
turn
a
projected
fourth
quarter
stockbuild
of
million
barrels
per
day
mbd
into
a
stockdraw
of
mbd
we
expect
iraqi
production
levels
to
remain
erratic
because
of
its
dispute
with
the
un
security
council
over
sanctions
and
exports
may
again
cease
at
some
point
such
a
development
would
have
a
price
supportive
effect
cera
s
price
outlook
for
remains
the
same
as
that
in
the
world
oil
watch
released
in
late
november
assuming
normal
winter
weather
and
no
prolonged
or
repeated
shutdowns
of
iraqi
production
the
projected
average
for
first
quarter
is
per
barrel
for
wti
however
this
outlook
is
based
on
opec
s
announcing
an
agreement
early
in
the
first
quarter
to
cut
its
production
by
the
start
of
the
second
quarter
a
failure
to
restrain
output
would
result
in
a
downward
adjustment
to
an
average
of
wti
for
the
first
quarter
of
with
prices
lower
in
the
second
half
of
the
quarter
than
in
the
first
the
downward
pressure
results
from
the
prospect
of
a
larger
than
usual
implied
build
in
stocks
during
the
second
quarter
of
about
mbd
with
a
cut
in
opec
output
iraq
in
a
twilight
zone
as
anticipated
iraq
ceased
exporting
oil
under
the
un
controlled
oil
for
food
program
as
of
december
in
protest
over
the
rejection
by
the
security
council
s
sanctions
committee
of
its
proposed
december
export
price
schedule
iraq
s
pricing
was
judged
by
the
un
overseers
who
monitor
the
export
program
and
advise
the
sanctions
committee
to
be
about
cents
per
barrel
below
comparable
crudes
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
offset
an
illicit
surcharge
that
iraq
was
seeking
from
buyers
although
the
standoff
with
the
sanctions
committee
continues
iraq
partially
resumed
exporting
on
december
since
then
about
mbd
has
been
exported
from
the
mina
al
bakr
terminal
in
the
persian
gulf
prior
to
the
shutdown
iraqi
exports
under
un
auspices
were
at
a
rate
of
mbd
for
november
as
compared
with
mbd
for
the
third
quarter
exports
for
november
were
about
mbd
from
mina
al
bakr
and
about
mbd
from
ceyhan
in
the
mediterranean
exports
from
ceyhan
have
not
resumed
owing
to
the
surcharge
dispute
with
the
result
that
about
mbd
of
iraqi
crude
remains
off
the
market
iraq
s
semi
shutdown
has
put
it
into
a
kind
of
twilight
zone
while
its
dispute
with
the
sanctions
committee
over
pricing
continues
in
the
midst
of
this
dispute
the
un
security
council
approved
phase
nine
of
the
oil
for
food
program
at
the
last
minute
on
december
it
became
effective
on
december
and
has
been
accepted
by
iraq
as
of
decemberl
iraq
s
revised
export
price
for
ceyhan
proposed
for
the
remainder
of
december
has
again
been
judged
too
low
by
the
overseers
and
is
expected
to
be
rejected
by
the
sanctions
committee
additionally
the
overseers
have
notified
lifters
of
iraqi
crude
that
any
oil
payment
made
directly
to
iraq
rather
than
to
the
un
escrow
account
would
be
a
violation
of
un
sanctions
buyers
of
iraqi
oil
from
mina
al
bakr
have
consistently
been
reported
as
saying
that
they
are
not
paying
a
surcharge
to
iraq
how
long
iraq
may
operate
at
about
half
capacity
is
unclear
but
it
continues
to
request
a
surcharge
payment
from
prospective
lifters
at
ceyhan
in
an
apparent
effort
to
circumvent
and
degrade
the
un
financial
controls
that
are
the
heart
of
the
sanctions
system
the
distinction
that
iraq
has
made
between
mina
al
bakr
and
ceyhan
arose
when
it
resumed
operations
at
mina
al
bakr
by
loading
two
cargoes
for
the
india
oil
company
iraq
may
have
judged
this
accommodation
to
be
in
its
interest
since
it
recently
also
signed
an
oil
exploration
contract
with
india
under
which
payments
would
be
made
in
oil
as
currently
structured
the
deal
would
violate
un
sanctions
but
india
is
seeking
an
exception
from
the
security
council
on
grounds
of
economic
hardship
the
exception
seems
unlikely
to
be
granted
which
may
lead
iraq
to
cease
exports
from
mina
al
bakr
again
there
are
many
possible
scenarios
that
iraq
could
follow
but
we
expect
uncertainty
about
iraqi
exports
to
continue
as
iraq
uses
its
oil
exports
as
leverage
to
undermine
sanctions
in
its
ongoing
struggle
with
the
security
council
to
end
all
restraints
consequently
the
iraq
factor
will
remain
an
element
in
the
oil
price
outlook
iraq
s
antisanctions
campaign
has
also
raised
the
visibility
of
the
iraq
issue
in
washington
as
the
incoming
bush
administration
prepares
to
take
office
secretary
of
state
designate
colin
powell
has
already
acknowledged
a
need
to
reassess
iraq
policy
and
has
said
that
he
would
work
to
reenergize
sanctions
the
iraq
issue
is
being
debated
in
virtually
every
foreign
policy
oriented
think
tank
in
washington
a
consensus
seems
to
be
emerging
around
seeking
renewed
international
support
and
legitimacy
for
sanctions
by
retaining
un
control
over
iraq
s
oil
revenue
and
strictly
enforcing
a
prohibition
on
sales
of
weapons
and
related
material
while
lifting
general
trade
controls
that
increasingly
are
both
ineffective
and
an
international
irritant
there
is
virtually
no
sentiment
in
favor
of
operations
to
destabilize
or
remove
the
saddam
hussein
regime
on
the
pragmatic
basis
that
the
prospects
for
success
are
remote
demand
trends
record
high
us
natural
gas
prices
have
increased
the
economic
incentive
for
gas
consumers
with
the
capability
to
switch
from
gas
to
distillate
to
do
so
and
reports
of
switching
are
emerging
in
a
number
of
areas
interruptible
gas
customers
with
resid
or
distillate
fuel
back
up
have
already
switched
to
oil
so
it
is
now
firm
gas
supply
customers
with
the
potential
to
add
to
the
already
high
level
of
distillate
demand
so
far
in
december
us
distillate
demand
is
running
at
a
record
high
december
level
of
mbd
however
only
a
small
portion
of
this
demand
is
the
result
of
economically
based
fuel
switching
from
gas
to
distillate
cera
estimates
that
the
additional
demand
likely
to
come
from
further
switching
of
gas
to
distillate
is
relatively
small
on
the
order
of
to
mbd
in
cera
s
view
it
is
likely
that
only
a
portion
of
the
theoretical
capacity
will
be
switched
on
short
notice
because
in
some
cases
this
theoretically
switchable
capacity
has
not
been
used
in
recent
years
and
tankage
and
delivery
infrastructure
may
be
in
uncertain
condition
switching
by
interruptible
gas
customers
such
as
utilities
to
distillate
began
about
a
month
or
more
ago
although
the
volumes
involved
are
relatively
small
switching
to
residual
fuel
already
occurred
months
ago
when
gas
prices
started
to
surge
in
the
summer
a
portion
of
the
us
secondary
and
tertiary
distillate
stockbuild
seen
this
autumn
was
likely
prompted
by
interruptible
gas
customers
filling
their
reserve
distillate
fuel
storage
given
the
expectations
of
a
tight
gas
market
regulators
have
been
explicit
about
enforcing
back
up
fuel
storage
requirements
in
the
months
leading
up
to
the
current
heating
season
other
end
users
of
natural
gas
have
few
or
no
options
for
fuel
switching
some
ammonia
and
ethane
producers
have
shut
down
operations
because
the
cost
of
feedstock
natural
gas
is
high
natural
gas
is
also
used
in
some
enhanced
oil
recovery
operations
and
some
of
these
producers
have
also
opted
to
sell
gas
back
to
the
grid
rather
than
produce
oil
supply
trends
non
opec
supply
for
the
fourth
quarter
is
expected
to
be
up
mbd
over
a
year
earlier
at

recent
events
include
a
shortfall
in
mexican

curtailed
in

growing
russian
crude
oil
production
throughout

supporting
a

surge
in
exports
in
spite
of
higher
export
taxes
russian
exports
of

volumes
reached
mbd
in

after
remaining
fairly
steady
at
about

though

fourth

oil
exports
are
expected
to
average
mbd
mbd
greater
than
in
the
fourth
quarter
cera
estimates
iraqi
oil
production
averaged
mbd
in
november
down
mbd
from
the
october
level
the
cutoff
in
exports
earlier
this
month
reduced
iraqi
output
for
the
first
days
of
december
to
roughly
mbd
iraq
resumed
exports
of
about
mbd
on
december
which
raised
production
to
mbd
assuming
no
change
in
iraq
s
current
production
stance
iraqi
production
would
average
mbd
for
december
on
a
quarterly
basis
the
decline
in
iraq
output
would
lead
to
estimated
opec
output
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
mbd
and
would
turn
an
estimated
global
oil
stockbuild
of
mbd
into
a
stockdraw
of
mbd
these
production
estimates
include
mbd
of
crude
oil
exports
to
syria
that
began
on
november
without
un
authorization

are
continuing

have
climbed
intermittently
from
an

in

and
reached
million

in
mid
december
see

since

crude

and
the

primary
inventories
of

heating

remain
well
below

earlier
levels
at
million
barrels
they
are
million
barrels
or
percent
less
than
those
of
a
year
ago
but
there
are
indications
of
builds
in
secondary
and
tertiary
inventories
we
estimate
that
wholesale
and
consumer
stocks
are
up
million
barrels
since
august
and
are
actually
higher
than
they
were
at
the
end
of
last

in
europe
crude
oil
stocks
are
at
more
comfortable
levels
when
compared
with
those
of
the
united

in
november
stocks
rose
nearly
million
barrels
to
million

at
this
level
they
are
below

well
above
the
low

of
early
see

japanese
crude
oil
inventories
at
end
october
were
million
