though
the

has
denied

that
it
has

to
china

it
deliberately

expensive
raw
material
ignoring
world
bank
warnings
has
worked
on
fanciful
demand
supply
estimates
and
several
legal
requirements
and
permissions
in
fact
the
committee
has
found
that
the
mseb
has
been
paying
enron
rs
crore
more
than
it
should
every
year
this
comprises
overcharging
of
rs
crore
on
account
of
the
large
regassification
plant
of
which
only
per
cent
of
the
capacity
is
used
for
dpc
there
s
also
a
rs
crore
extra
billing
to
the
mseb
for
shipping
and
harbour
charges
although
the
cost
of
these
facilities
had
been
included
in
the
capital
recovery
charge
by
charging
more
than
twice
the
operations
maintenance
rate
stipulated
by
the
government
of
india
enron
collects
approximately
rs
crore
extra
every
year
it
has
also
been
collecting
rs
crore
every
year
through
inflated
fuel
consumption
claims
enron
has
been
charging
at
kcal
kwh
under
the
power
purchase
agreement
ppa
although
the
equipment
manufacturer
has
guaranteed
it
a
much
lower
consumption
rate
this
gives
it
a
fat
fuel
arbitrage
opportunity
at
the
cost
of
the
people
of
maharashtra
the
committee
has
also
pointed
to
the
strange
practice
of
using
four
different
exchange
rates
for
different
aspects
of
the
project
negotiation
a
rate
of
rs
per
dollar
was
assumed
for
calculating
debt
service
of
rupee
loans
rs
per
dollar
as
reference
rate
for
phase
i
rs
per
dollar
as
reference
rate
for
phase
ii
and
a
curious
rs
per
dollar
for
calculating
government
of
india
tariff
forcing
a
reduction
of
these
excessive
charges
has
nothing
to
do
with
contract
cancellation
all
it
needs
is
tough
negotiation
and
public
pressure
on
the
political
establishment
the
godbole
committee
has
established
that
dpc
s
tariffs
can
easily
be
halved
if
excess
payments
are
eliminated
and
unfair
conditions
such
as
the
dollarisation
of
payments
the
take
or
pay
clause
and
escrow
facility
which
is
in
fact
hampering
mseb
s
reform
particularly
in
power
distribution
are
scrapped
the
security
of
future
payments
to
dpc
under
the
restructured
tariff
would
be
based
on
increased
cash
flows
from
a
reformed
distribution
system
the
committee
also
gives
enron
a
difficult
escape
route
it
says
that
if
the
multinational
finds
the
conditions
for
restructuring
too
onerous
it
should
free
mseb
from
its
contractual
obligations
and
find
buyers
outside
maharashtra
the
committee
has
tried
to
establish
another
precedent
on
all
projects
negotiated
by
government
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
what
is
being
contracted
on
their
behalf
and
has
recommended
that
all
documents
including
contracts
related
to
all
independent
power
projects
ipps
particularly
dpc
should
be
published
by
the
maharashtra
government
within
two
months
also
having
established
that
demand
supply
estimates
by
the
state
government
were
fanciful
the
committee
has
asked
mseb
to
defer
all
negotiations
with
power
producers
until
demand
levels
in
the
state
permit
full
absorption
of
power
generation
from
such
ipps
it
recommends
that
such
negotiations
should
be
in

with
the
least

plan
spelt

in

by

under

the
failure
of

and
failure
of

the

and
has
initiated
conciliation
and
arbitration
proceedings
the
company
resolution
said
consistent
with
this
recourse
to
contractual
remedies
the
company
now
seeks
the
authority
to
serve
preliminary
termination
notices
and
transfer
notices
pursuant
to
clause
and

of
the

from

giving

in
the
name
and
for
and
on

of
the
company
against
this
backdrop
the
state
government
and
mseb
have
been
exploring
the
possibilities
of
issuing
termination
notice
to
the
dpc
for
its
failure
to
meet
the
contractual
obligations
under
the
ppa
the
state
government
and
mseb
sources
said
that
such
a
notice
could
be
served
by
the
mseb
as
dpc
has
not
paid
the
rebate
penalty
of
rs
crore
for
misdeclaration
and
default
on
the
availability
of

on
january

the

government
and
mseb
which
reviewed
its
position
on
saturday
at
a
meeting
convened
by
the
chief

vilasrao
deshmukh
are
of
the
view
that
they
have
a
strong
case
and
substantial
grounds
to
slap
the
termination
notice
to
the
dpc
the
dpc
s
move
to
appoint
mr
k
wade
cline
as
its
true
and
lawful
attorney
in
fact
deserves
importance
especially
when
the
state
government
proposes
to
set
up
a
negotiating
committee
to
cut
the
per

cost
and
gauge
the
possibility
of
sale
of

the

story
of
dabhol
if

judicial
probe
suggested
by
the

is
ordered
into
the
enron
deal
it
could

three
governments
ranjit

the

has
prima

found
infirmities
in
several
decisions
taken
in

project
at
different
points
of

by
successive
governments
and
agencies
in

state
energy
review
committee
headed
by
former
home
secretary
madhav
godbole
this
could
well
be
the
real
enron
story
a

high

and
including
former

and

official
vinay
mohan
lal
has
recommended
a
judicial
probe
into
the
entire
enron
power
project
deal
saying
it
signified
the
utter
failure
of
governance
that
seems
to
have
characterised
almost
every
step
of

relating

the
dabhol
project
the
report
which
was
submitted
to
the
maharashtra
government
last
fortnight
and
has
been
acquired
by

is
severely
critical
of

headed

the
utter
failure
of

seems
to
have
characterised
almost
every
step
of
decision
making
relating
to
the
dabhol
project
madhav
godbole
committee
report
an
investigation
if
ordered
could
embarrass
at
least
these
three
governments
the
report
clearly
upholds
the
allegations
of
money
being
paid
by
enron
to
politicians
and
bureaucrats
for
clinching
the
deal
according
to
the
committee
the
deal
reveals
failure
of
governance
both
at
the
centre
and
state
and
across
different
agencies
it
strains
belief
to
accept
that
such
widespread
and
consistent
failure
to
execute
responsibilities
is
purely
coincidental
the
report
said
proposing
a
set
of
measures
to
be
implemented
if
something
of
the
project
was
to
be
retrieved
godbole
and
sarma
also
felt
that
the
panel
should
categorically
recommend
the
government
of
india
to
order
a
judicial
inquiry
this
was
finally
adopted
by
it
says
a
congress
leader
enron
could
well
become
the
biggest
political
issue
in
maharashtra
and
put
to
question
liberalisation
particularly
in
the
power
sector
the
proposal
has
already
struck
panic
says
ncp
s
praful
patel
if
the
enron
decision
has
at
all
been
detrimental
it
is
because
of
the
haste
with
which
phase
was
cleared
by
the
shiv
sena
bjp
government
now
with
the
state
having
already
entered
into
an
agreement
with
enron
the
important
thing
is
to
resolve
it
amicably
a
judicial
inquiry
will
be
an
eyewash
because
it
s
not
an
issue
of
corruption
but
that
of
perception
pro
market
congressmen
privately
admit
that
it
was
their
governments
at
the
centre
and
the
state
which
invited
enron
even
though
the
second
phase
was
cleared
by
the
bjp
shiv
sena
combine
says
congress
spokesperson
jaipal

right
now
we
re
too
involved

that
such
witch
hunting
could
send

non

mps
from
maharashtra
meanwhile
claim
that
the
godbole
committee
was
instituted
with
the
express
purpose
of
politicising
the
enron
issue
i
think
i
know
vilasrao
deshmukh
s
gameplan
says
an
mp
from
the
state
but
some
mps
like
congress
prithviraj
chavan
question
the
cloak
of
secrecy
that
s
surrounded
the
deal
i
ve
maintained
for
long
that
there
should
be
a
judicial
committee
to
examine
this
the
committee
report
also
says
that
had
the
enron
project
been
subjected
to
a
techno
economic
appraisal
as
envisaged
under
provisions
of
the
electricity
supply
act
of
and
related
legislations
the
infirmities
could
have
been
avoided
since
this
wasn
t
done
questions
about
a
concerted
effort
towards
exercising
undue
influence
at
every
stage
of
the
project
are
bound
to
arise
the
exhaustive
page
report
points
out
i
d
highlight
the
speed
with
which
the
day
vajpayee
government
cleared
the
project
minutes
before
it
quit
says
congress
mp
prithviraj
chavan
the
enron
project
had
been
held
out
as
an
exemplar
of
the
impending
liberalisation
in
the
early
s
and
despite
several
controversies
is
now
an
established
power
project
at
dabhol
km
south
of
mumbai
in
july
enron
signed
an
mou
with
the
maharashtra
state
electricity
board
mseb
to
set
up
a
mw
station
as
part
of
the
government
s
fast
track
projects
subsequently
when
the
shiv
sena
bjp
came
to
power
in
maharashtra
it
filed
a
writ
against
the
project
this
curiously
led
to
renegotiations
with
enron
the
committee
has
quoted
a
bombay
high
court
order
on
the
renegotiated
deal
once
it
gom
decided
to
revive
the
project
it
acted
in
the
very
same
manner
its
predecessors
in
office
had
done
it
forgot
all
about
competitive
bidding
and
transparency
the
speed
with
which
the
negotiating
group
studied
the
project
and
made
its
proposal
for
renegotiatons
which
was
accepted
by
dabhol
is
unprecedented
says
chavan
i
would
particularly
like
to
highlight
the
speed
with
which
the
day
vajpayee
government
at
centre
endorsed
the
renegotiated
project
minutes
before
it
resigned
since
the
commissioning
of
the
plant
in
may
the
mseb
has
paid
rs
crore
for
the
power
it
has
bought
from
dabhol
if
the
same
watttage
of
power
had
been
bought
from
indian
built
power
plants
fired
by
indigenous
coal
the
payment
would
have
been
approximately
rs
crore
in
the
first
year
and
a
half
of
its
operation
itself
the
dpc
had
drained
the
maharashtra
exchequer
of
nearly
rs
crore
the
central
electricity
authority
cea
in
fact
pointed
out
that
the
dabhol
plant
was
not
the
least
costly
option
the
mseb
had
other
inexpensive
alternatives
like
the
four
units
of
kaparkheda
but
they
were
in
a
preliminary
stage
the
report
notes
if
the
mseb
had
made
efforts
to
seriously
pursue
these
projects
they
might
not
have
remained
in
their
preliminary
stages
it
adds
that
the
members
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
mseb
and
the
maharashtra
government
erred
seriously
based
on
information
available
at
that
time
in
proceeding
with
the
dpc
as
a
base
load
factor
even
when
its
capacity
was
reduced
the
failure
seems
to
have
been
compounded
by
the
laxity
of
the
union
power
ministry
finance
ministry
and
the
cea
it
quotes
the
cea
as
saying
that
since
the
union
finance
ministry
found
the
tariff
reasonable
no
further
examination
was
required
strangely
bal
thackeray
s
shiv
sena
when
it
came
to
power
together
with
the
bjp
in
maharashtra
filed
a
writ
in
the
court
and
then
renegotiated
the
deal
after
the
new
shiv
sena
bjp
government
took
over
its
cm
manohar
joshi
appointed
a
renegotiating
committee
in
which
made
the
right
noises
actually
managing
to
reduce
the
tariff
but
certain
things
remained
inexplicable
no
fresh
clearances
were
required
from
the
cea
which
also
said
that
since
no
cost
increase
was
involved
fresh
formal
clearance
wasn
t
necessary
says
the
committee
this
only
adds
strength
to
the
suspicion
that
the
cea
didn
t
consider
the
economic
aspects
of
the
project
at
all
indeed
given
the
non
availability
of
any
official
record
of
the
meeting
on
june
with
the
committee
and
the
nature
of
this
letter
dated
december
the
committee
is
doubtful
whether
the
economic
aspects
of
dpc
were
discussed
at
all
the
credibility
of
the
shiv
sena
bjp
government
has
been
seriously
questioned
the
committee
finds
it
unexplicable
sic
why
there
was
no
mention
of
any
reduction
in
capital
cost
of
the
project
from
million
to
million
as
agreed
by
dpc
in
the
summary
report
of
the
renegotiating
committee
the
panel
observes
says
lawyer
prashant
bhushan
it
is
strange
that
the
shiv
sena
bjp
government
first
filed
a
writ
in
the
court
and
then
coolly
renegotiated
the
deal
the
committee
further
spells
out
the
losses
incurred
through
the
deal
subsequent
to
the
commissioning
of
the
dpc
the
financial
deterioration
of
mseb
has
been
rapid
while
the
mseb
was
in
profit
in
it
plunged
into
huge
losses
of
rs
crore
in
significantly
the
world
bank
in
had
predicted
the
system
s
inherent
weaknesses
in
a
letter
written
to
the
then
power
secretary
r
vasudevan
a
top
bank
official
had
said
that
after
a
detailed
review
of
the
analytical
framework
and
costing
assumptions
we
reconfirm
our
earlier
conclusion
that
the
dabhol
project
as
presently
formulated
is
not
economically
justified
and
that
in
our
assessment
the
project
is
too
large
to
enter
the
mseb
system
in
the
proposed
base
load
operation
could
result
in
uneconomic
plant
dispatch
as
already
existing
lower
variable
cost
coal
power
would
be
replaced
by
the
higher
cost
lng
power
enron
s
persistence
and
the
gullibility
of
the
indian
side
can
be
gauged
from
high
ranking
enron
official
joe
sutton
s
letter
to
a
key
indian
official
ajit
nimbalkar
i
recently
met
with
the
world
bank
and
have
been
following
the
articles
in
the
india
papers
i
feel
that
the
world
bank
opinion
can
be
changed
we
ll
engage
a
pr
firm
and
hopefully
manage
the
media
from
here
on
the
project
has
solid
support
from
all
other
agencies
in
washington
the
key
question
in
the
enron
deal
is
whether
a
developed
state
like
maharashtra
needs
outside
intervention
in
the
power
sector
at
all
for
the
first
time
the
godbole
committee
has
raised
objections
about
the
viability
of
such
a
project
according
to
the
report
the
mseb
has
been
one
of
the
better
performing
boards
in
the
country
and
has
despite
a
faulty
transmission
and
distribution
t
and
d
system
managed
to
consistently
earn
net
revenue
surpluses
on
an
accrual
basis
maharashtra
accounts
for
nearly
one
fourth
of
the
gross
value
of
india
s
industrial
sector
it
s
one
of
the
few
states
to
achieve
per
cent
electrification
since
the
mseb
has
been
adding
to
its
generation
this
improvement
which
has
been
largely
due
to
renovation
and
modernisation
undertaken
by
the
mseb
exceeded
its
own
expectations
at
a
time
when
the
dpc
was
being
considered
the
report
points
out
following
a
policy
of
cross
subsidy
roughly
nine
out
of
its
ten
users
are
subsidised
but
the
gap
between
the
average
cost
of
supply
and
average
realisation
hasn
t
been
much
in
fact
the
subsidy
claim
decreased
from
rs
crore
in
to
rs
crore
in
until
in
it
increased
nearly
five
fold
to
rs
crore
due
to
the
sudden
increase
in
the
gap
by
paise
per
unit
from
to
paise
an
increase
of
per
cent
the
increase
in
the
subsidy
claim
by
rs
crore
is
due
to
the
increase
in
the
gap
principally
because
of
the
increase
in
power
purchase
costs
says
the
committee
adding
without
the
dpc
and
without
problems
of
t
and
d
loss
the
mseb
could
be
financially
healthy
but
can
that
happen
now
since
enron
is
here
to
stay
the
committee
has
come
up
with
some
far
reaching
recommendations
make
public
all
dabhol
related
documents
and
agreements
restructure
the
dabhol
project
itself
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
power
restructure
dpc
financially
allow
sale
of
dpc
power
outside
maharashtra
re
examine
ppas
in

with

plans
and
thoroughly
reform
the
mseb
the
committee
know
this
can
become
reality
only
with
political
consensus
and
through
forming
of
public

the
question
is
can

the

touted
as

was
conveniently
camouflaged
under

has
authorised

to
take

this
misuse
of
