latest
draft
vince
i
have
added
a
lot
of
material
to
fill
in
the
wholes
and
would
like
your
reaction
to
the
current
draft
i
am
still
not
very
happy
with
the
risk
management
segment
primarily
as
a
result
of
my
own
lack
of
knowledge
so
please
read
it
carefully
and
get
me
your
comments
i
plan
to
let
don
chew
the
editor
take
a
look
at
it
to
give
us
his
guidance
toward
a
successful
draft
hope
you
are
having
a
great
day
and
tremendous
start
to
the
new
year
your
friend
john
p
s
i
really
enjoyed
your
papers
those
should
definitely
be
part
of
a
class
on
risk
management
