dear
ms
feldman
please
receive
all
my
apologies
for
not
having
answered
earlier
your
emails
but
i
was
in
the
states
for
weeks
and
could
not
access
my
dauphine
email
in
any
case
the
time
was
fruitfully
used
by
my
associates
and
myself
to
improve
the
robustness
of
the
product
from
a
computer
and
mathematical
standpoint
regarding
your
points
we
agree
on
the
price
of
usd
d
g
will
provide
system
support
we
can
do
so
by
emailing
anther
version
of
the
software
being
available
on
the
phone
and
by
email
but
we
can
not
promise
unlimited
support
of
all
kinds
without
risking
bankruptcy
right
away
moreover
the
may
be
paid
in
fractions
and
your
risk
would
be
quite
minimal
regarding
the
escrow
we
have
been
using
so
far
a
small
law
firm
with
partners
none
of
my
family
in
amherst

brown
golowich
and

but
we
are
not
closed
to
anther
solution
you
would
strongly
prefer
best
