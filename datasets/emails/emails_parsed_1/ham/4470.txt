i
could
pick
you
up
at
the
airport
or
you
could
rent
a
car
and
come
to
campus
i
have
made
tentative
plans
for
us
to
go
to
lunch
with
some
other
faculty
between
and
and
then
you
would
have
some
time
to
visit
with
sheridan
and
perhaps
with
some
other
faculty
members
as
well
between
lunch
and
my
class
sheridan
and
a
guest
speaker
from
his
class
suresh
sundaresan
from
columbia
will
be
joining
us
for
dinner
i
could
provide
transportation
to
your
hotel
and
pick
you
up
for
dinner
as
well
if
you
consider
that
to
be
the
most
convenient
alternative
i
will
have
a
pc
available
in
the
classroom
with
office
and
windows
nt
you
could
use
powerpoint
with
no
difficulty
from
that
machine

that
s
most
convenient
you
could
simply
email
the
presentation

i
would
have
it
for

prefer
how
much
time

you
like

would
like
to
reserve
about
minutes
at
the
end
for
a
general
discussion
of
issues
related
to
real
options
and
about
minutes
at
the
beginning
of

some
remarks
regarding
the
final
assignment
and
a
class
evaluation
by
the
students
which
is
required
for
all
classes
at
some
point
we
should
take
a
brief
break
so
that
would
leave
approximately
to
hours
for
your
presentation

you
would
like
that
flexibility
otherwise
i
could
take
up
the
slack
i
look
forward
to
seeing
you
