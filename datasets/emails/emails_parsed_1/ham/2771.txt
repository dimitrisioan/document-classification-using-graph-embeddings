re
the
consultant
s
model
for
gary
hickerson
s
group
the
model
is
supposed
to
be
a
real
option
model
to
capture
the
value
of
power
plants
of
gencos
it
is
to
give
trader
a
better
insight
as
to
whether
the
market
is
overvaluing
undervaluing
certain
genco
stocks
and
trader
can
act
accordingly
i
m
still
trying
to
find
out
how
trader
is
supposed
to
use
it
modeling
details
the
model
takes
in
all
gencos
locational
power
forward
prices
and
fuel
forward
prices
and
uses
garch
model
to
simulate
one
year
daily
prices
and
then
uses
a
hourly
profile
to
convert
them
into
hourly
prices
garch
model
parameters
are
estimated
by
the
consultant
using
and
separate
model
and
are
updated
twice
a
year
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
simulation
starts
in
january
or
september
using
these
prices
it
will
determine
whether
a
unit
at
a
particular
location
will
be
dispatched
or
not
depending
on
a
spread
of
power
and
fuel
prices
and
b
whether
the
start
up
cost
can
be
recovered
during
operation
hours
the
unit
can
be
dispatched
at
minimum
and
peak
levels
fixed
o
m
sox
and
nox
i
don
t
know
what
the
last
two
stand
for
are
taken
into
consideration
with
the
simulated
dispatch
schedule
the
model
calculates
the
value
that
can
be
generated
by
this
unit
then
sums
it
up
across
all
units
the
final
value
is
the
average
of
simulations
and
it
takes
about
hours
to
run
for
about
units
after
our
conversation
the
consultant
promised
to
look
into
a
how
to
make
the
model
more
flexible
say
to
allow
a
different
time
horizon
b
reduce
spreadsheet
overhead
by
doing
calculation
one
unit
a
time
and
not
saving
all
the
intermediate
information
as
of
now
it
saves
everything
on
the
spreadsheet
assuming
the
garch
process
is
modelled
correctly
i
believe
the
methodology
is
ok
though
it
does
not
capture
most
of
the
optionality
my
concerns
are
whether
the
price
processes
are
modelled
correctly
i
have
to
get
more
details
before
making
any
conclusion
simulations
are
way
too
few
unless
we
convert
the
algorithm
to
c
i
don
t
see
how
spreadsheet
can
handle
more
simulations
i
guess
that
s
why
they
contact
us
but
again
if
enron
s
buying
the
model
from
the
consulting
company
why
should
enron
do
their
job
for
them
how
trader
s
going
to
use
the
model
output
for
this
i
phoned
jeff
the
associate
who
initiated
all
these
and
am
still
waiting
for
his
returning
call
a
related
questions
why
the
model
horizon
is
one
year
we
can
either
oversee
the
conversation
but
not
doing
actual
coding
for
them
or
redo
the
model
for
them
the
problem
still
remains
that
how
trader
s
going
to
use
the
output
but
in
view
of
the
great
wall
of
china
separating
the
business
units
should
we
do
it
as
of
now
i
have
a
simulation
model
taking
start
up
cost
fixed
o
m
rump
up
delay
into
consideration
it
simulates
monthly
prices
using
gbm
and
takes
minutes
seconds
to
run
simulations
for
one
unit
for
ten
years
time
steps
it
can
use
forward
forward
vol
and
incorporate
seasonality
into
it
i
understand
this
is
debatable
one
interesting
observation
is
that
when
using
forward
forward
vol
simulation
the
standard
deviation
is
about
while
standard
deviation
using
forward
vol
is
about
also
incorporating
seasonality
increases
the
value
by
about
since
most
of
the
time
cost
occurs
in
price
simulation
and
we
are
to
simulate
about
price
processes
i
hope
the
full
model
if
we
build
it
will
take
a
couple
of
hours
to
run
for
units
the
main
task
will
be
interfacing
i
e
getting
data
from
data
base
and
outputting
the
results
this
is
where
i
need
most
help
if
i
am
to
do
it
please
advice
the
course
of
action
i
am
supposed
to
talk
to
michelle
cisneros

never
promised
