hi
vince
please
put
your
best
effort
in
making
sure
that
we
differentiate
summer
interns
and
associates
that
ebs
research
will
be
hiring
i
am
talking
about
compensation
here
ken
rice
mentioned
that
ebs
is
in
the
process
of
developing
a
technical
equivalent
of
our
aa
pool
ebs
research
people
can
potentially
rotate
through
this
pool
in
the
future
i
just
don
t
want
to
risk
losing
people
like
giuseppe
get
the
word
out
that
we
are
low
ballers
because
we
have
to
fit
them
into
certain
set
of
categories
that
was
designed
for
the
energy
business
i
realize
that
you
have
estabilished
such
differentiation
for
research
as
a
whole
but
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
moved
up
a
notch
in
the
case
of
ebs
