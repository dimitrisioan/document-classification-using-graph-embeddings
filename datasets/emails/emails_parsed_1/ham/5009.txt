celeste
greetings
as
you
may
recall
i
am
the
director
of
the
univ
of
texas
center
for
energy
finance
cefer
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
initiate
planning
for
your
colleague
vince
kaminski
s
annual
presentation
to
the
ut
foundations
of
energy
finance
class
which
i
will
be
presenting
as
usual
the
first
half
of
the
fall
semester
thus
to
begin
i
wonder
whether
either
the
above
is
your
current
e
mail
account
and
with
the
departure
of
meryl
barnett
with
whom
i
believe
we
coordinated
this
in
the
past
whether
this
is
an
issue
within
your
scope
with
respect
to
this
reception
i
appreciate
that
there
may
be
other
enron
receptions
scheduled
for
this
fall
however
if
you
so
choose
i
would
like
to
afford
you
the
opportunity
of
scheduling
an
enron
reception
following
vince
s
presentation
if
you
would
indeed
like
to
do
so
i
suggest
we
coordinate
with
vince
the
date
for
the
presentation
reception
