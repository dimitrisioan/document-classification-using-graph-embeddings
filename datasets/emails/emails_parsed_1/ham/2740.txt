university
of
waterloo
ontario
canada
has
recently
started
to
be
very
interested
in
the
recent
developments
of
the
bandwidth
market
we
find
that
the
specifics
of
the
bandwidth
market
offer
challenges
from
the
modelling
point
of
view
however
we
have
encountered
difficulties
when
looking
for
data
and
we
were
wondering
if
you
could
help
us
specifically
we
would
like
to
know

a
given
city

of
the

for
a

type
of

we
realize
that
some
of
these
questions
may
ask
for
confidential
data
in
that
case
we
would
really
appreciate
if
an
order
of
magnitude
was
provided
i
look
forward
to

from
you
