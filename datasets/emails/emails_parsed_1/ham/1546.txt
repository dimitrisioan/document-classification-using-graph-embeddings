re
final
pivot
table
for
mg
metals
globals
positions
data
dear
all
please
see
attached
spreadsheet
we
will
have
to
think
of
a
way
to
automate
the
position
update
right
now
it
s
a
manual
process
to
convert
the
text
file
that
andreas
sends
us
to
proper
spreadsheet
format
and
then
pivot
table
the
results
only
takes
about
minutes
to
do
this
however
note
that
the
version
la
var
model
links
via
vlookup
to
the
spreadsheet
attached
as
you
know
we
have
to
use
vlookup
because
mg
does
not
necessarily
have
positions
in
all
forward
months
whilst
the
pivot
table
only
produces
numbers
for
forward
months
with
a
position

re
positions
data
our
pivot
table
we
noticed
that
copper
position
for
th
july
has
option
included
but
this
is
not
reported
in
mercur
i
guess
we
should
include
the
tonnes
for
the
copper
option
for
but
we
won
t
show
any
gamma

re
positions
data
hi
tanya
we
are
using
the
data
for
th
july
from
andreas
see
file
attached
we
are
using
this
because
we
can
reconcile
to
mercur
print
out
that
we
got
from
andreas
last
wednesday
if
you
don
t
mind
perhaps
cantekin
can
try
again
with
this
new
sheet
attached
we
already
looked
at
it
but
would
like
to
see
what
cantekin
can
come
up
with
independently
i
think
the
positions
changed
a
lot
from
rd
july
your
data
to
th
july
thanks
