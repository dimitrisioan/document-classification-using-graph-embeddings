i
enjoyed
talking
with
you
this
afternoon
regarding
possible
enron
argonne
national
laboratory
collaboration
as
i
mentioned
one
of
our
divisions
decision
information
sciences
has
built
state
of
the
art
tools
for
modeling
and
simulating
energy
use
they
have
trained
many
country
energy
ministries
on
the
use
of
their
tools
as
well
as
solved
complex
energy
technology
issues
i
ve
attached
a
presentation
which
describes
some
of
their
capabilities
in
this
area
decision
information
sciences
also
has
done
much
work
in
studying
critical
infrastructure
issues
in
both
gas
and
electric
systems
which
also
may
be
of
interest
finally
they
have
been
pioneers
in
the
development
of
agent
based
complex
adaptive
systems
for
modeling
very
complex
systems
that
are
impossible
to
view
with
over
approaches
i
will
also
include
a
copy
of
my
correspondences
with
one
of
your
e
business
groups
under
separate
