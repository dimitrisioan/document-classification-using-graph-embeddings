just
a
quick
email
to
start
some
discussion
about
the
panel
session
you
are
involved
in
during
risk
in
boston
on
similarly
it
is
often
interesting
to
hear
the
panel
s
comments
on
one
individual
s
more
specific
area
of
knowledge
conseqently
if
you
could
return
this
email
to
all
panel
members
with
topics
you
feel
should
be
covered
any
particular
areas
you
would
personally
like
to
focus
on
any
proposed
changes
to
the
actual
panel
structure
and
possibly
additonal
panel
members
you
think
should
be
there
that
would
be
a
good
start
i
am
still
in
the
process
of
looking
for
a
moderator
and
if
anyone
has
any
suggestions
please
let
me
know
the
talk
title
is
effectively
applying
