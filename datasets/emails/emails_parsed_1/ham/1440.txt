s
paper
comments
in
the
sentence
between
eqn
and
eqn
i
think
annualized
volatility
should
replace
annualized
standard
deviation
as
to
the
comment
immediately
we
see
something
quite
counter
intuitive
i
would
disagree
i
think
that
its
quite
intuitive
that
this
model
should
get
closer
to
the
black
scholes
price
as
what
is
defined
as
the
jump
component
becomes
just
part
of
the
main
price
distribution
which
happens
if
we
define
a
jump
to
be
only
a
sigma
event
the
table
does
show
however
that
the
results
of
using
this
model
are
very
sensitive
to
exactly
how
you
choose
to
define
a
jump
i
e
sigma
or
sigma
events
and
this
is
one
difficulty
in
using
the
model
in
practice
in
the
paragraph
after
the
table
i
don
t
understand
the
argument
about
hedging
the
option
especially
about
buying
a
swap
which
would
pay
on
the
difference
between
the
strike
and
fs
this
seems
non
sensical
i
could
not
follow
the
logic
of
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
article
so
this
point
should
probably
be
explained
more
clearly
