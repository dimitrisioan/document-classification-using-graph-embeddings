dear
lucie
when
i
agreed
to
speak
at
the
above
conference
it
was
agreed
that
enron
could
bring
another
staff
member
to
attend
gratis
however
i
noticed
that
enron
is
actually
providing
two
speakers
dr
vince
kamainski
and
myself
it
would
be
appreciated
if
we
could
instead
of
sending
two
staff
members
to
the
same
seminar
that
enron
sends
one
staff
member
to
the
aust
energy
seminar
and
one
staff
member
to
the
risk
sydney
seminar
in
august
the
length
pricing
are
similar
for
both
the
seminars
upon
your
reply
i
will
supply
the
names
of
the
staff
members
there
is
strong
internal
competition
to
go

you
