hi
vince
yannis
of
the
weather
desk
is
planning
to
develop
relationship
with
prof
rene
carmona
in
doing
weather
analysis
to
start
this
off
they
are
planning
to
pay
prof
carmona
to
give
a
training
class
as
outlined
below
and
they
want
to
know
if
research
is
willing
to
send
people
and
bear
part
of
the
costs
we
can
talk
more
at
pm
but
while
there
is
no
doubt
that
getting
people
from
outside
to
present
new
ideas
is
always
important
and
interesting
i
think
research
group
members
can
easily
give
most
of
these
talks
apparently
people
are
interested
in
these
topics
and
are
willing
to
pay
to
listen
my
thought
is
that
if
the
intent
is
to
develop
relationships
that
is
fine
but
the
research
group
should
also
be
given
the
opportunity
to
provide
more
training
and
get
more
visibility
i
have
already
communicated
this
to
joe
and
to
yannis
