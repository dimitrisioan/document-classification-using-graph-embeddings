hi
maureen
and
gwyn
on
the
oxford
analytica
front
i
m
glad
you
have
found
the
service
useful
our
contract
with
them
has
expired
and
we
are
currently
negotiating
for
more
users
to
have
access
our
current
contract
is
for
k
or
k
per
user
per
year
we
can
charge
k
back
to
you
on
the
iif
front
the
invoice
for
k
is
due
at
the
end
of
the
month
here
i
would
propose
that
we
pay
two
thirds
to
cover
our
costs
and
the
costs
of
our
competitive
analysis
colleagues
in
london
leaving
k
for
you
to
cover
since
we
took
on
these
services
last
year
we
have
expanded
our
range
of
sources
and
projects
and
are
consequently
trying
to
do
more
with
less
thus
i
need
to
allocate
some
of
our
costs
from
oxan
and
iif
to
other
projects
let
me
know
what
you
think
about
this
proposal
maureen

on
your
secondment
