houston
visits
dear
all
shirley
has
kindly
arranged
the
accommodation
for
these
new
dates
i
d
be
grateful
if
we
could
stick
to
the
dates
that
you
confirmed
to
me
below
as
it
will
be
next
to
impossible
to
change
these
again
of
course
it
should
be
fine
for
you
to
arrive
a
day
early
to
lose
your
jet
lag
and
depart
a
day
late
so
that
you
get
a
full

let
me
know
if
you
have
any
more
logistical
questions
i
might
even
be
able
to
suggest
some
nice
restaurants
for
cars
i
think
that
is
best
arranged
from
london
when
the
flight
is
booked
by
the
way
you
will
all
need
a
full
uk
drivers
licence
to
hire
the
car
and
a
passport
with
more
than
a
six
months
to
go
before
expiry
shirley
would
it
be
best
to
use
the
usual
coupons
on
the
guest
car
park
ticket
method
for
parking
