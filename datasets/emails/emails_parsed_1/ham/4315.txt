vlady
i
enclosed
the
file
with
backtesting
plots
you
saw
them
before
the
following
table
shows
what
was
the

when

these

are

this
shows
that
when
we
have
more
observations
columns
corresponding
to
var
and
var
compared
to
the
column
corresponding
to
var
the
frequency
of
curve
shift
being
lower
than
var
becomes
closer
to
the
theoretical
value
and
the
numbers
in
the
column
var
are
very
close
to
this
is
the
argument
in
favor
of
using
historical
vols
and
also
the
results
do
not
depend
on
the
decay
factor
in
this
experiment
also
notice
the
numbers
in
column
var
are
higher
than
and
this
is
an
indication
of
fat
tails
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
