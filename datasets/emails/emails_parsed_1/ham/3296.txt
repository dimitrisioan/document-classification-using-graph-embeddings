both
thanks
for
your
comments
and
comparisons
it
is
good
to
get
context
based
on
your
comments
here
would
be
my
proposal
o
basic
salary
ol
k
kickers
for
each
of
the
years
these
are
paid
as
a
lump
sum
on
each
anniversary
guaranteed
therefore
guaranteed
salary
is
effectively
o
this
is
completely
separate
and
in
addition
to
any
performance
bonus
increase
the
value
of
options
to
o
k
to
vest
as
before
which
leaves
a
hanging
out
there
at
the
end
of
the
contract
just
fyi
anjam
is
currently
on
o
but
does
not
have
an
agreement
so
this
would
effectively
put
a
k
gap
between
the
two
let
me
know

thoughts

bonus

thanks

the

well
but
here
the
market
for
quants
is
very
hot
steve
is
in
my
view
an
exceptionally
talented
person
and
i
would
go
an
extra
mile
to
retain
him
long
term
for
the
company
i
would
adjust
the
base
salary
or
the
kicker
upward
a
bit
o
basic
is
what
anjam
is
receiving
currently
if
i
remember

a
much
higher
value
