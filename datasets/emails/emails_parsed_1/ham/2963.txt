the
exponentials
we
tried
earlier
a
bexp
cx
etc
fit
well
but
gave
negative
numbers
in
the
bootstrapping
i
tried
a
b
t
c
a
standard
power
law
and
as
the
accompanying
graph
shows
for
the
months
the
fits
are
quite
good
in
this
case
the
ffvols
do
not
become
negative
i
believe
this
corresponds
to
your
beta
i
would
have
preferred
exp
t
and
variants
can
explain
owing
to
mean
reverting
vols
but
the
power
law
might
be
a
practical
alternative
from
an
implementation
standpoint

re

forward
volatilities
following
up
on
our
discussions
i
implemented
one
method
for
creating
forward
forward
curve
from
implied
vol
curve
i
sorted
out
forward
curves
from
an
original
forward
vol
curve
each
of
curves
corresponding
to
certain
month
then
i
fitted
each
of
curves
with
a
function
y
a
a
power
x
b
beta
i
figured
out
that
when
beta
is
from
the
above
function
is
suitable
for
performing
our
bootstrapping
routine
of
deriving
ff
vols
from
implied
because
y
x
t
y
x
t
x
t
y
x
y
x
tx
for
all
x
t
i
have
to
double
check
on
this
again
also
when
beta
there
are
some
combinations
of
parameters
a
a
b
beta
for
which
above
equality
holds
even
with
restriction
on
beta
this
class
of
functions
represents
quite
a
variety
of
shapes
below
you
see
the
example
of
fitting
as
well
as
the
example
of
ff
vol
curve
constructed
from
implied
vol
curve
for
ng
i
ll
try
this
for
power
as
well
