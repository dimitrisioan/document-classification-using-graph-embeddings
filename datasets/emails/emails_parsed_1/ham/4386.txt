after
brainstorming
and
discussing
further
on
data
here
we
think
that
our
final
specifications
for
modelling
data
requirement
need
to
be
as
follows
we
need
bankrupt
default
and
nondefault
which
covers
nonbankrupt
accounts
with
quarterly
observation
snapshots
and
months
performance
following
the
latest
snapshot
monthly
performance
indicator
need
to
be
available
for
the
entire
months
performance
period
we
will
need
all
the
bankrupt
and
default
accounts
and
comparable
sample
of
good
accounts
with
weights
for
the
purpose
of
model
validation
we
will
need
data
with
above
specs
covering
months
of
performance
this
means
that
we
will
need
rolling
quarterly
snapshots
months
performance
data
for
monthly

we
will
need
bankruptcy
chapterwise
indicator
if
available
during
the
performance
period
our
definition
of
default
is
either
bankruptcy
or
days
delinquency
on
any
trade
credit
we
have
also
discussed
the
cost
aspect
and
we
think
considering
the
big
picture
it
makes
sense
to
spend
the
extra
amount
to
get
the
right
data
for
analysis
please
let
me
know
your
thoughts
this
will
require
d
b
to
give
us
a
modified
quote
and
we
could
possibly
move
forward
quickly
