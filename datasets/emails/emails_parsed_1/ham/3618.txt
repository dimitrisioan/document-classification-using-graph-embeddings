resumes
molly
below
are
the
resumes
sent
to
us
by
focus
vince
suggested
that
we
interview
one
person
plus
sriram
who
already
lives
in
houston
karim
looks
like
the
most
qualified
but
my
fear
is
that
we
may
not
be
able
to
afford
him
i
am
assuming
that
vince
will
want
to
hire
at
most
at
the
manager
level
can
you
first
check
and
see
if
karim
would
consider
coming
at
a
manager
level
salary
before
we
spend
time
talking
with
him
if
he
is
too
senior
then
we
should
talk
to
samir
who
looks
like
a
more
junior
level
person
