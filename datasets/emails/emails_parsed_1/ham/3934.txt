subject
presentation
for
cal
berkeley
hello
vince
and
john
i
wanted
to
forward
to
you
both
the
current
presentations
for
campus
we
can
tweak
these
however
we
feel
appropriate
to
match
cal
berkeley
on
monday
i
believe
that
we
can
probably
expect
about
students
based
on
interest
shown
at
the
career
fair
these
tend
to
be
fairly
informal
i
was
thinking
that
we
could
present
in
this
order
vince
gives
the
enron
overview
presentation
minutes
john
gives
the
global
technology
specific
presentation
minutes
ashley
goes
over
recruiting
information
at
the
end
minutes
please
take
a
look
at
each
presentation
and
speaker
notes
to
ensure
that
you
feel
comfortable
with
the
layout
and
content
i
am
meeting
with
john
today
at
vince
if
you
would
like
to
get
together
and
discuss
as
well
that
would
be
great
if

any
questions

t
hesitate
to
contact
me
