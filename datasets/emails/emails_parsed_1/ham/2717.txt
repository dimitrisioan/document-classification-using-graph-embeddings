preliminary
model
la
for
mg

var
that

have
put
together
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
look
at
the
var
by
metal
for
positions
as
of
th
july
subject
to
some
data
that
needs
updating
correcting
we
still
need
to
update
some
information
data
flow
processes
as
follows
i
factor
loadings
for
silver
gold
cocoa
beans
and
tc
treatment
charge
for
copper
concentrate
ii
check
correlations
between
nickel

alu
and
nickel

copper
i
got
different
answers
to
houston
iii
ensure
latest
forward
price
curves
are
included
perhaps
through
live
link
to
telerate
reuters
iiia
price
for
silver
is
wrong
units
should
be
per
troy
ounce
and
similarly
for
gold
price
should
be
per
troy
ounce
also
we
need
cocoa
bean
forward
curve
iv
find
a
better
way
to
extract
positional
information
from
mg
metals
link
to
the
spreadsheet
in
an
automated
fashion
v
add
minor
metals
like
cobalt
palladium
platinum
cadmium
etc
n
b
we
have
troy
ounces
of
palladium
short
posn
and
troy
ounces
platinum
long
as
