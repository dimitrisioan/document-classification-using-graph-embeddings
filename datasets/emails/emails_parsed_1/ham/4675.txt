we
need
to
be
careful
as
the
s

static
pool
figures
show
a
definite
seasoning
lower
defaults
in
late
years
probably
due
to
prepayment
versus
our
contracts
secondly
the

figures
have
withdrawn

which
usually
mean
they
are
stale

i
will
ask
emy

up
a

thanks
i
would
strongly
suggest
an
offsite
sooner
than
later
with
a
handful
of
the
right
people
so
that
we
can
step
back
and
design
the
right
architecture
for
looking
at
credit
in
our
deals
it
is
broken
not
clear
killing
our
velocity
and
true
capabilities
we
also
need
to
look
at
staffing
skills
sets
the
credit
reserve
model
etc
perhaps
you
should
take
a
crack
at
an
agenda

i
visited
with
vince
kaminski
for
about
minutes
today
regarding
the
market
implied
defaults
rates
and
the
disconnect
in
investment
grade
land
he
is
seeing
the
same
anomaly
and
agreed
that
we
as
a
company
need
to
revisit
the
methodology
employed
in
calculating
the
implied
figures
i
will
follow
through
and
report
back
