netware
has
shipped
with
btrieve
originally
a
flat
file
database
system
now
grown
into
a
full
fledged
relational
database
system
since
the
days
of
netware
some
years
ago
many
independent
software
vendors
have
relied
on
this
and
constructed
their
netware
applications
to
use
the
built
in
facilities
btrieve
afforded
originally
licensed
from
its
creator
softcraft
novell
bought
btrieve
outright
in
the
late

s
then
sold
it
off
years
later
to
some
of
the
original
developers
now
incorporated
as
pervasive
software
pervasive
has
essentially
retired
the
btrieve
name
in
favor
of
pervasive
sql
a
true
relational
database
system
which
nevertheless
still
purports
to
support
applications
written
to
the
btrieve
x
specification
a
major
change
has
been
introduced
in
netware
however
there
is
no
longer
an
unlimited
use
version
of
the
database
included
novell
still
uses
btrieve
technology
for
among
other
things
its
installed
products
database
sys
system
products
dat
is
the
file
but
netware
includes
only
a
two
user
license
for
sql
enough
for
the
administrator
to
add
new
products
and
services
but
not
enough
for
any
btrieve
based
applications
the
network
might
be
running
there
is
an
unlimited
use
version
of
sql
included
but
it

s
an
evaluation
version
only
it
will
time
out
after
days
full
use
licenses
may
be
purchased
from
pervasive
software
or
your
software
vendors
may
provide
them
but
unsuspecting
network
administrators
could
be
caught
off
guard
when
applications
stop
working
for
the
adventurous
there
is
an
unlimited
use
version
of
btrieve
included
with
the
netware
distribution
but
novell
admits
it
hasn
t
tested
the
software
with
netware
it
may
not
work
and
the
real
killer
most
current
applications
such
as
computer
associates
arcserve
require
btrieve
check
the
applications
you
re
using
before
doing
that
upgrade
to
netware
and
calculate
the
additional
costs
of
obtaining
the
requisite
number
of
sql
licenses
then
decide
if
that
s
what
you
want
to
do
or
if
switching
to
a
different
application
is
the
better
choice
