during
today
s
var
coordination
meeting
we
had
a
discussion
of
issues
related
to
mapping
of
the
forward
price
curves
into
core
locations
mapping
is
a
necessity
dictated
by
the
limitations
of
the
computer
system
we
have
to
reduce
the
dimensionality
of
the
problem
to
stay
within
the
bounds
of
available
cpu
memory
also
in
some
cases
the
quality
of
price
discovery
is
poor
and
it
s
difficult
to
model
the
price
curves
independently
we
solve
the
problem
by
mapping
them
into
more
liquid
and
better
behaved
core
locations
curves
we
have
agreed
on
the
following
winston
will
investigate
the
it
side
and
determine
to
what
extent
we
can
increase
the
number
of
forward
price
curves
that
are
simulated
as
basic
core
curves
he
will
investigate
the
impact
of
a
larger
number
of
the
core
curves
on
the
time
required
to
complete
the
var
run
the
curves
associated
with
the
biggest
positions
in
each
commodity
should
be
modeled
as
core
curves
i
e
no
mapping
into
other
locations
it
makes
sense
to
monitor
the
biggest
risks
separately
and
avoid
aggregating
them
into
less
transparent
aggregates
the
results
of
an
automated
clustering
mapping
procedures
should
be
systematically
monitored
by
a
human
and
corrected
if
they
misrepresent
the
risks
of
the
trading
positions
this
responsibility
should
be
vested
with
one
person
right
now
the
responsibility
is
dispersed
through
the
organization
and
this
means
in
practice
that
nobody
is
responsible
research
can
allocate
one
person
to
this
task
cooperation
of
trading
and
rac
will
be
critical
