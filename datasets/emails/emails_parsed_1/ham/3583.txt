for
george
posey
vince
here
is
an
analysis
of
the
fund
giving
at
the
church
first
off
it
appears
from
the
data
that
a
special
appeal
for
fund
giving
was
made
from
the
pulpit
on
april
and
april
perhaps
tied
rhetorically
into
income
taxes
then
by
going
back
and
incorporating
obvious
dates
from
the
calendars
for
the
following
regression
analysis
is
made
where
each
effect
is
added
independently
giving
this
sunday
a
minor
weekly
time
trend
i
e
multiply
by
the
number
of
weeks
since
jan
no
pure
effect
from
last
week
s
contributions
i
e
denies
first
order
autoregressive
effects
if
easter
sunday
or
the
sunday
nearest
christmas
if
pastoral
appeal
april
or
april
if
the
sunday
falls
on
the
weekend
of
a
monday
federal
holiday
if
the
sunday
following
thanksgiving
if
a
summer
weekend
june
thru
august
the
pure
time
trend
is
very
small
so
an
annual
projection
based
on
all
years
data
would
be
for
giving
to
increase
only
a
minor
amount
for
assuming
a
similar
appeal
for
giving
is
made
