subject

s
a
third
try
vince
while
i
was
at
hsb
i
designed
an
insurance
or
reinsurance
financial
model
that
hsb
uses
for
new
product
development
pricing
different
reinsurance
strategies
computing
stochastic
earnings
forecast
and
estimating
probabilistic
maintenance
repair
costs
the
code
written
in
visual
basic
ms
access
belongs
to
hsb
and
i
want
to
replicate
it
here
for
our
use
at
enron
i
would
like
to
arrange
a
time
to
specifically
talk
to
you
and
perhaps
vasant
who
was
briefed
on
the
model
about
how
we
can
use
your
group
for
the
analytical
and
programming
support
to
get
this
model
re
constructed
i
have
screen
outputs
from
the
code
and
vasant
thought
the
re
design
and
construction
here
at
enron
is
a
problem
that
your
group
can
do
could
you
let
me
know
when
we
can
setup
an
hour
to
discuss
thanks
