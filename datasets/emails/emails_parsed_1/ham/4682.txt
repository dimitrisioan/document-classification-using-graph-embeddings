the
great
divide
lodge
that
will
expire
on
you
can
either
use
that
credit
for
individual
rooms
prior
to
or
we
have
agreed
that
we
can
apply
that
amount
to
a
meeting
prior
to
the
thanksgiving
holiday
in
if
the
contract
is
signed
before
at
this
point
august

available
but
the
is

if
we
can

this
signed

would
be
able
to
be
applied

this
event
