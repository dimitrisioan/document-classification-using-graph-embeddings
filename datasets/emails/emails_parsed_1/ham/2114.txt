re
garp

dear
vince
thank
you
for
your
recent
enquiry
concerning
a
complimentary
pass
to
the
two
day
garp
convention
unfortunately
it
is
not
garp
s
policy
to
allow
this
for
a
number
of
reasons
garp
is
a
not
for
profit
organisation
will
much
lower
delegate
fees
and
still
the
same
overheads
than
other
conference
organizers
garp
s
mission
is
to
allow
an
educational
forum
for
furtherance
of
financial
risk
management
and
an
opportunity
to
allow
networking
and
contact
time
between
financial
risk
professionals
however
in
an
attempt
to
remain
at
ease
with
my
speakers
i
would
like
to
offer
a
discount
off
the
delegate
fee
for
one
of
you
colleagues
in
enron
this
will
be
for
the
two
day
convention
and
will
include
the
gala
awards
evening
on
th
february
which
had
over
three
financial
and
risk
professionals
at
garp
i
trust
that
this
is
satisfactory
if
you
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
this
please
fax
a
completed
registration
form
along
with
a
brief
covering
note
referring
to
this
e
mail
and
i
will
ensure
that
our
administration
depart
handle
the
relevant
paper
work
if
you
have
any
questions
please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
i
look
forward
to
your
response
and
to
meeting
you
in
new
york
in
february
and
receiving
a
copy
of
your
presentation
in
a
few
days
kind
regards

dear
garp
speaker
this
is
just
a
quick
note
to
keep
you
up
to
date
with
developments
at
the
garp
convention
which
will
be
held
in
new
york
between
th
and
th
february
thus
far
garp
looks
set
to
far
exceed
our
expectations
and
garp
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
convention
delegate
bookings
have
been
much
higher
than
this
time
last
year
as
a
result
we
are
set
to
far
exceed
the
number
of
delegates
that
attention
earlier
this
year
the
three
workshops
and
the
one
day
asset
management
forum
are
also
very
well
received
and
will
probably
reach
full
capacity
i
will
of
course
provide
you
with
much
fuller
details
closer
to
the
time
of
the
event

would
like
a
few
outstanding
issues
presentations

you

th
december
so
that
i
have
enough
time
to
reproduce
them
and
place
them
in
a
delegate
pack
for
the
convention
given
the
break
of
the
christmas
and
new
york
period
and
that
the
event
is
being
held
in
new
york
i
am
sure
you
can
appreciate
that
there
are
certain
logistical
factors
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
hence
the
reason
why
the
presentations
are
required
as
soon
as
possible
this
is
purely
for
reproduction

also
