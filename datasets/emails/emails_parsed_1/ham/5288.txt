i
m
not
sure
what
to
think
other
than
we
really
don
t
have
a
credible

to
determine
what
will
happen
with
the
pdo
one
factor
that
provides
insight
into
the
climate
outlook
for
the
next
few
months
and
next
few
seasons
is
the
expected
changes
with
enso
for
which
there
is
some
demonstrated
skill
in
forecasting
the
latest
observations
show
trends
to
near
normal
enso
conditions
with
some
indication
that
ocean
temperatures
will
likely
be
a
bit
warmer
than
normal
in
the
tropics
if
this
is
true
i
d
expect
a
slight
bias
toward
el
nino
like
climate
over
north
america
which
would
tend
to
go
against
the
continuation
of
cold
