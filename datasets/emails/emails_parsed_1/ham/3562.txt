re
draft
analysis
hi
trushar
please
find
attached
our
draft
analysis
it
is
still
very
preliminary
as
we
have
not
been
provided
the
latest
version
of
legal
documents
and
so
the
analysis
reflects
our
understanding
of
the
economics
of
the
transaction
as
outlined
to
us
based
on
discussions
with
enron
and
available
prior
draft
documentation
the
analysis
uses
the
enron
share
price
as
of
march
and
assumes
the
ljm
distribution
is
based
on
m
or
irr
we
anticipated
that
this
might
reach
irr
based
on
enron
discussions
with
ljm
please
call
