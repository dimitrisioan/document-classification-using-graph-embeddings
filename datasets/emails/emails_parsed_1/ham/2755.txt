vince
the
last
three
years
were
characterized
by
exceptionally
high
volatility
of
the
power
prices
in
the
us
markets
the
market
developments
have
created
a
number
of
unique
challenges
for
energy
industry
economists
one
immediate
question
we
have
to
answer
is
how
to
measure
volatility
of
energy
prices
although
we
can
all
agree
that
the
prices
in
the
power
markets
are
characterized
by
high
variability
the
traditional
measures
used
in
financial
economics
annualized
standard
deviation
of
log
price
returns
may
not
fit
well
electricity
prices
the
second
challenge
is
to
explain
the
sources
of
high
price
volatility
and
to
answer
the
question
to
what
extent
it
can
be
attributed
to
problems
that
can
be
addressed
in
the
long
run
such
problems
include
flaws
in
market
design
that
allow
some
market
participants
to
abuse
market
power
limited
availability
and
or
unequal
access
to
transmission
temporary
shortages
of
generation
capacity
some
factors
underlying
high
volatility
of
electricity
prices
may
be
of
permanent
nature
and
may
be
a
necessary
price
to
pay
for
increased
market
efficiency
and
expanded
customer
choice
