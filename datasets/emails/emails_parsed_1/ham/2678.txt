i
understand
that
you
or
someone
in
your
group
had
a
demo
from
the
above
group
last
friday
i
was
wondering
if
this
was
part
of
a
push
to
bring
more
options
analytics
to
the
traders
desks
and
if
so
if
you
could
explain
what
that
effort
looks
like
one
of
the
global
markets
traders
mario
de
la
ossa
also
had
a
look
at
the
software
as
he
has
used
it
in
the
past
thanks
kevin
