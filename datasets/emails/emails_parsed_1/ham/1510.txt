highly
recommended
this

s
visit
to
houston
along
with
the
two
standford

i
have
handed
over
the
task
of
arranging
such
visits
to
elisabeth
grant
she
will
arrange
everything
and
charge

hi
krishan
ravi
i
apologize
for
the
delay
in
mailing
the
writeups
some
unforeseen
complications
completely
shot
the
last
day
i
am
attaching
pdf
versions
of
the
first
two
chapters
of
my
thesis
which
should
help
get
a
sense
of
what
we
are
trying
to
do
two
more
technical
modeling
writeups
for
services
i
am
attempting
to
model
the
writeups
are
as
i
mentioned
before
works
in
progress
and
incomplete
and
therefore
i
apologize
in
advance
for
confusions
that
might
arise
i
also
request
that
you
not
circulate
these
widely
for
obvious
reasons
thanks
