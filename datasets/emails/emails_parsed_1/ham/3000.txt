hello
everyone
this
memo
only
applies
to
the
research
group
on
the
th
floor
that
use
the
colored
printer
taj
mahal
vince
has
requested
that
i
ask
each
of
you
to
only
use
the
colored
printer
taj
mahal
for
presentations
newsletters
etc
that
require
at
least
of
color
these
cartridges
are
very
expensive
and
several
times
we
have
picked
up
a
copy
of
something
that
only
had
color
on
the
first
page
and
it
would
be
maybe
pages
long
this
is
not
cost
effective
if
you
have
something
that
has
color
on
the
first
page
but
not
on
the
rest
of
the
presentation
then
please
just
print
the
first
page
on
the
color
printer
and
the
rest
on
bandit
or
wagon
your
help
will
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
shirley
