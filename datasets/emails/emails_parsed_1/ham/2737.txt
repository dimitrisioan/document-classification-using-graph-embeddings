re
hello
from
vince
kaminski
at
enron
vince
thank
you
for
forwarding
the
following
messages
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
just
now
getting
back
to
you
my
lotus
notes
was
down
all
afternoon
yesterday
we
currently
have
the
cal
berkeley
general
presentation
set
for
wednesday
october
th
at
p
m
which
works
out
well
because
it
is
just
prior
to
the
time
deadline
for
students
to
submit
their
resumes
the
general
presentation
is
a
general
overview
of
enron
the
program
the
interview
process
as
well
as
a
chance
for
students
to
meet
and
chat
with
enron
reps
since
this
is
the
first
year
that
we
are
recruiting
from
cal
berkeley
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
i
attend
this
event
on
campus
so
that
i
can
answer
any
interview
process
questions
i
will
check
the
schedule
and
see
if
it
is
possible
to
move
the
presentation
to
the
rd
the
only
negative
is
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
attend
because
i
will
be
conducting
interviews
at
rice
that
day
also
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
location
to
hold
the
presentation
and
i
need
to
check
on
location
availability
on
the
rd
however
i
do
think
that
we
should
take
advantage
of
the
seminar
on
campus
this
may
mean
that
they
are
two
seperate
trips
to
campus
perhaps
we
can
also
set
up
some
other
presentations
for
the
rd
or
even
the
monday
prior
although
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
attend
the
class
seminar
presentations
i
don
t
think
that
it
is
as
vital
as
the
general
presentation
what
are
your
thoughts
