just
some
of
george
gail
s
observations
he
expects
wti
crude
prices
to
return
to
a
range
of
barrel
by
q
brent
although
emotions
rather
than
fundamentals
will
continue
to
drive
the
market
saudi
s
sold
cal
naphtha
at
m
t
over
the
platt
s
ag
mean
and
the
kuwaiti
s
are
offer
their
naphtha
at
m
t
over
the
mean
enoc
offered
tons
of
term
naphtha
and
only
sold
tons
adnoc
s
splitters
should
add
even
more
naphtha
supplies
to
the
market
koch
has
closed
their
rotterdam
splitter
due
to
poor
economics
not
necessarily
a
permanent
shutdown
he
expects
the
brent
dubai
spread
to
return
to
more
normal
barrel
regarding
condensate
he
predicts
that
actual
demand
will
drive
the
market
and
there
will
be
less
bottomfeeding
by
the
japanese
and
other
refiners
he
does
feel
the
new
splitters
will
reduce
the
worldwide
volumes
available
but
that
there
will
still
be
adequate
supplies
he
thinks
crack
spreads
for
refiners
will
still
be
weak
during
cal
although
some
resid
demand
will
be
displaced
by
natural
gas
or
lng
he
expects
fairly
stable
differentials
to
crude
he
expects
strong
us
gasoline
demand
but
limits
his
demand
growth
projection
to
for
the
year
