and
she
will

up
on
the
points
you
kindly
reported
although
i
am
of
course
available
to
assist
where
necessary
tanya
will
remain
the
point
of
contact
for
var
modelling
in
houston
and
of
course
kirstee
and
tanya
will
work
together
on
this
to
resolve
these
and
further
issues
i
would
be
happy
to
help

meetings

re

live

anjam
thanks
for
your
var
model
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
following
position
data
i
noted
that
the
outright
longs
shorts
for
copper
include
positions
which
we
should
not
use
i
e
r
wolff
quantities
this
positions
are
imputed
into
the
system
at
their
integrity
some
legs
hedges
are
missing
this
affects
copper
and
lead
position
for
now
the
issues
should
be
have
been
sorted
out
by
the
end
of
this
month
ie
next
week
so
in
copper
you
have
mt
to
much
and
with
lead
you
have
mt
to
much
as
of
june
looking
at
copper
position
you
calculate
a
var
of
with
a
total
outright
of
mt
this
seams
too
low
if
i
calculate
x
x
mil
us
var
outright
qty
x
price
levelx
risk
factor
riskfactr
as
per
mercur
in
my
view
we
have
been
understating
var
in
mercur
because
we
do
not
consider
the
spread
position
correctly
i
e
in
detail
on
a
position
like
that
i
would
expect
a
figure
of
around
mil
us
i
guess
the
issue
is
in
the
volatility
and
in
the
holding
period
your
correlation
matrix
for
the
commodities
is
not
final
i
assume
as
many
fields
are
blank
lets
talk
tomorrow
on
the
phone
attached
please
find
the
position
summary
for
the
last
week
since
june
as
requested

kirstee
