re
cross
guarantees
attached
are
the
latest
drafts
of
of
the
cross
guarantee
agreements
i
have
the
other
nine
as
well
in
case
you
need
them
the
agreements
are
basically
identical
with
one
exception
the
debt
to
enron
in
raptor
approx
mm
is
excluded
from
the
guarantees
you
may
also
note
that
this
debt
is
not
represented
on
the
dprs
which
i
sent
earlier
this
is
because
the
formation
of
raptor
was
a
failed
fas
transaction
therefore
we
did
not
get
sale
treatment
and
can
t
recognize
the
debt
in
looking
at
credit
capacity
let
me
know
if
you
have
questions
or
if
you
need
the
other
nine
guarantees
