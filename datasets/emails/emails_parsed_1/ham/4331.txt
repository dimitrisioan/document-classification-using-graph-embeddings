attend
you
presentation
at
power
thanks
i
appreciate
it
i
shall
ask
about
a
guest
accounton
eol
typically
such
an
account
allows
an
outside
user
to
take
a
look
at
the
system
but
i
don
t
think
the
traders
will
allow
systematic
access
to
the
price
data
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
a
third
party
i
quite
understand
and
will
appreciate
the
ability
to
use
the
system
while
the
permission
is
applicable
would
you
like
to
meet
with
me
alex
helyette
for
dinner

would
be
delighted
to
join
you
