alex
i
m
glad
that
we
had
a
chance
to
talk
today
about
a
weatherdelta
overview
the
th
is
not
really
going
to
work
well
for
us
due
to
recent
reschedulings
several
members
of
the
weatherdelta
team
will
be
in
or
near
houston
on
the
th
and
th
of
november
i
know
that
you
said
that
week
was
tight
and
could
arrange
to
be
in
the
several
weeks
following
those
dates
i
have
attached
our
standard
non
disclosure
agreement
which
we
will
need
to
execute
prior
to
the
product
demonstration
i
have
also
attached
a
reprint
of
a
recent
article
describing
weatherdelta
s
approach
and
functionality
as
soon
as
a
meeting
can
be
scheduled
a
list
of
attendees
would
be
very
helpful
to
us
in
preparing
the
appropriate
materials
thank
you
again
