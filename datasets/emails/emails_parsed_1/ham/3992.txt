many
dear
vince
i
apologize
for
not
having
got
back
to
karla
earlier
but
dauphine
is
not
properly
equipped
yet
the
conference
with
samuelson
merton
heath
ross
mckean
etc
was
spectacular
academics
and
practitioners
came
to
college
de
france
and
were
very
grateful
i
was
so
worn
out
afterwards
that
i
did
not
make
it
to
houston
i
just
went
to
visit
alex
after
a
week
conference
on
quantitative
risk
management
where
i
was
speaking
at
carnegie
mellon
another
former
phd
student
of
mine
has
been
testing
and
improving
the
software
he
is
great
and
modest
giving
the
papers
i
referee
and
the
conferences
i
go
to
i
do
believe
that
we
are
still
ahead
or
way
ahead
today
we
also
beautifully
simplified
the
valuation
of
the
hourly
swings
obviously
in
case
of
a
problem
my
reputation
and
your
esteem
would
be
more
valuable
than
of
usd
to
be
shared
i
declined
risk
in
houston
and
newyork
and
am
not
sure
i
will
have
the
pleasure
to
see
you
in
london
in
all
cases
we
should
coordinate
for
paris
soon
