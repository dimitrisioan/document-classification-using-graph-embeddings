impending
visit
july
vince
i
plan
to
be
in
houston
on
july
i
would
like
very
much
to
get
together
with
you
and
perhaps
your
investment
guy
on
friday
morning
on
the
th
if
you
and
or
he
have
the
time
or
perhaps
on
the
th
in
the
afternoon
i
would
like
to
continue
the
discussions
about
your
using
marketpoint
and
about
your
investment
guy
considering
marketpoint
if
he
is
interested
when
you
see
the
progress
we
have
made
i
think
you
will
agree
that
it
merits
consideration
as
a
part
of
enrononline
com
as
well
as
a
profitable
investment
in
its
own
right
it
is
still
in
the
situation
where
it
can
be
provided
exclusively
to
whomever
i
choose
i
have
been
very
very
careful
how
i
have
promoted
it
so
that
i
do
not
get
committed
to
a
second
rate
partner
i
also
have
what
i
think
is
a
fundamentally
new
general
markovian
forward
optionality
evaluator
i
wrote
my
ph
d
dissertation
at
stanford
in
the
s
defended
with
honors
in
semi
markovian
decision
processes
during
the
heyday
of
that
research
and
i
have
seen
direct
applications
in
optionality
evaluation
i
think
you
will
be
fascinated
to
see
and
review
it
it
is
presently
implemented
in
prototype
form
and
it
could
be
made
available
to
the
first
large
retainer
client
on
an
exclusive
basis
who
is
sufficiently
interested
if
you
want
to
be
that
retainer
client
that
would
be
of
interest
to
me
give
me
a
shout
via
return
email
or
by
my
cell
phone
at
regarding
schedule
i
am
out
of
town
this
week
but
available
via
email
or
phone
at
the
above
addresses
i
really
hope
we
can
get
together
that
week
if
we
possibly
can
thanks
very
much
for
considering
my
request
and
thanks
very
much
for
being
the
go
between
with
your
investment
guy

deeply
