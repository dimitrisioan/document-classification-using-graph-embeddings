hi
vince
i
d
originally
been
told
you
wouldn
t
be
back
until
wednesday
and
so
have
another
meeting
booked
for
pm
london
time
today
i
really
need
to
speak
with
you
about
the
situation
here
in
london
re
anjam
to
be
blunt
sharad
kirstee
and
i
have
all
been
tempted
to
just
walk
out
of
the
office
until
anjam
is
removed
the
major
problems
are
i
have
no
authority
to
demand
anjam
should
cooperate
with
sharad
kirstee
etc
on
their
work
he
does
his
best
to
impede
their
work
and
i
have
no
ability
to
access
his
drives
for
data
spreadsheets
anjam
removes
me
from
the
cc
lists
in
reply
to
all
emails
received
by
him
in
an
attempt
to
remove
me
from
the
loop
anjam
continues
to
do
business
and
people
in
london
still
think
he
s
head
of
research
pending
your
announcement
people
will
continue
to
go
to
anjam
and
the
business
will
remain
dependent
on
him
we
re
severely
under
resourced
i
m
still
awaiting
your
review
of
the
email
i
drafted
for
john
s
requesting
additional
resource
i
can
t
make
a
big
recruitment
drive
until
i
have
the
authority
to
hire
more
i
honestly
feel
i
can
t
do
my
job
and
i
m
currently
asking
myself
what
i
m
even
doing
here
notwithstanding
the
above
here

the
current
