panel
discussion
dear
all
would
like
to
set
a
conference
call
to
discuss
content
for
the
panel
discussion
at
risk
in
boston
on
june
perhaps
i
can
suggest
wednesday
may
at
noon
est
i
m
on
london
time
and
am
quite
flexible
if
you
would
like
to
do
earlier
or
indeed
on
another
day
the
panellists
are
vince
kaminski
enron
corp
richard
jefferis
koch
energy
trading
steven
bramlet
aquila
the
discussion
topic
is
effectively
applying
weather
derivatives
i
think
we
need
to
establish
a
series
of
questions
around
which
to
facilitate
discussion
we
currently
don
t
have
a
moderator
and
perhaps
one
of
you
could
take
this
role
on
i
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
