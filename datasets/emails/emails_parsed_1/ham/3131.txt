hi
vince
i
am
writing
you
at
this
time
to
inquire
as
to
the
potential
of
renewing
my
internship
at
enron
for
the
summer
of
while
the
date
of
my
request
is
later
than
i
would
have
wished
the
reason
is
that
i
had
originally
planned
to
go
back
to
turkey
this
summer
and
get
my
mandatory
military
duty
done
however
i
now
realize
i
can
put
it
off
to
a
further
date
that
left
me
wondering
if
you
believe
there
is
a
project
that
i
can
get
involved
in
this
summer
and
be
useful
if
that
were
the
case
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
postpone
my
military
duty
and
spend
the
summer
with
the
research
group
i
discussed
this
with
dr
ronn
and
he
is
very
supportive
of
this
idea
i
apologize
again
for
bringing
up
this
issue
late
and
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
best
regards
