good
news
cabinet
approval
for
power
trading
team
today
union
cabinet
has
approved
the
proposal
of
ministry
of
industry
to
allow
foreign
equity
participation
in
power
trading
this
was
conveyed
by
secretary
power
during
his
meeting
with
wade
in
normal
course
the
proposal
was
slated
to
be
coming
up
for
cabinet
in
next
few
weeks
keeping
in
view
the
developments
of
dpc
invoking
state
guarantee
perhaps
cabinet
has
hurried
it
up
the
exact
proposal
approved
was
to
allow
foreign
equity
participation
through
automatic
route
upto
for
trading
in
power
sector
subject
to
prevailing
laws
irrespective
of
urgency
of
this
approval
to
us
the
best
thing
is
that
we
are
getting
the
approval
without
draft
electricity
bill
being
finalised
as
most
of
you
are
aware
initially
the
proposal
was
stalled
at
fipb
level
pending
finalisation
of
electricity
bill
then
it
has
gone
to
group
of
ministers
who
had
taken
a
positive
approach
and
now
the
cabinet
has
cleared
it
now
fipb
either
issue
an
approval
to
enron
llc
or
advise
us
to
avail
automatic
route
we
will
have
one
of
it
culminating
great
team
work
seethayya
