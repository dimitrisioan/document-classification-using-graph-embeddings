fyi
i
may
have
to
stay
over
weekend
vince
if
that
is
the
case
i
may
have
to
bring
my
wife
or
allow
her
to
go
to
her
sister
for
a
week
etc
i
may
ask
john
to
cover
some
of
that
cost
as
i
think
he
is
done
with
other
people
i
ve
seen
other
guys
family
members
showup
this
cost
would
equal
what
ebs
would
have
spend
to
send
me
home
and
bring
me
back
again
