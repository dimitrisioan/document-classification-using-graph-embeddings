it
appears
that
things
are
filling
up
fast
among
the
open
topics
listed
techniques
for
the
clarification
and
quantification
of
operational
risk
within
the
energy
industry
and
var
stress
testing
and
extreme
value
theory
within
an
enterprise
risk
management
framework
seem
to
be
the
best
we
have
liberty
to
suggest
our
own
topic
maybe
along
the
lines
of
asset
liability
management
do
you
have
a
preference

conference
dear
kevin
following
our
telephone
conversation
please
find
attached
a
summary
of
topics
proposed
for
inclusion
in
the
forthcoming
enterprise
risk
management
conference
last
year
the
event
attracted
over
eighty
delegates
and
more
are
expected
this
year
the
conference
will
be
held
in
houston
on
thursday
th
and
friday
th
november
with
a
pre
conference
seminar
on
the
th
as
we
discussed
i
would
be
delighted
to
invite
enron
to
lead
a
session
i
would
be
happy
to
consider
any
of
the
available
sessions
or
if
you
have
a
session
that
you
feel
is
currently
missing
from
the
programme
do
not
hesitate
to
make
a
suggestion
i
have
attached
a
file
that
gives
an
indication
of
the
topics
that
have
been
identified
so
far
although
i
have
bullet
points
for
the
sessions
i
would
first
like
to
identify
interested
parties
and
then
work
with
them
to
develop
a
session
that
reflects
their
particular
expertise
and
experience
i
also
think
that
by
continuously
developing
the
points
we
can
make
greater
allowances
for
continuity
between
each
participant
i
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
soon
yours
sincerely
