vacation
vince
i
just
found
out
that
none
of
my
vacation
days
from
the
last
year
is
in
the
computer
system
it
says
that
i
have
c
over
days
it
was
november
when
i
asked
your
approval
to
carry
over
vacation
days
to
the
next
year
i
was
thinking
that
if
you
or
hr
do
not
approve
i
could
at
least
take
these
days
in
i
know
that
your
tried
to
help
me
and
sent
to
brad
mcsherry
the
justification
for
me
to
carry
over
days
i
bothered
you
a
few
times
in
november
and
december
and
since
your
response
was
optimistic
i
did
not
take
any
of
those
days
in
but
i
never
heard
from
hr
now
i
am
not
sure
may
be
these
days
are
not
in
the
system
by
mistake
i
would
like
to
take
of
them
in
march
from
to
what
is
your
advice
should
i
contact
brad
mcsherry
even
negative
response
from
hr
in
november
or
december
last
year
would
be
better
than
loosing
vacation
days
i
really
appreciate
your
help

vacation
hi
vince
sorry
to
bother
again
with
my
question
i
first
e
mailed
my
question
a
month
ago
on
nov
since
we
still
have
not
heard
from
hr
is
it
fair
to
assume
that
i
can
carry
over
my
vacation
days
to
the
next
year
if
not
i
have
to
take
days
before
dec
because
then
i
go
on
vacations
anyhow
i
would
really
prefer
not
to
take
off
most
of
december
there
are
quite
a
lot
of
things
going
on
thank
you
for
your
help
in
resolving
this
question
