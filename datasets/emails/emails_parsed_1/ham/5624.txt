hi
vince

and
possibly
stinson
as
well
will
be
attending
this
initial
meeting
looks
like
kick
off
type
of
meeting
i
will
try
to
attend
to
drill
into
what
they
can
offer
and
what
we
have
committed
make
sure
that
we
get
from
the
arrangement

hello

a

meeting
on

a
metrics
caida
oeg
mailing
list
i
ve
set
up
a
single
mailing
list
with
this
name
for
discussions
on
wg
topics
passive
measurements
etc
to
start
with
it
s
a
moderated
list
i
e
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
list
to
post
to
it
you
join
by
sending
email
to
nevil
caida

asking
to
be
added
to
the
metrics
list
with

two
questions
for

i
who
else
would
you
suggest
be
invited
to
join
the
list
ii
should
the
list
continue
to
be
moderated
or
should
it
be
changed
into
an
open
list
b
working
group
developments
following
the
caida
members
meeting
on
feb
i
ve
attempted
to
define
exactly
what
problem
we
could
consider
getting
an
ietf
working
group
started
on
my
summary
of
the
existing
ietf
wgs
with
interests
in
metrics
is
given
below
appendix
b
but
it
seems
unlikely
that
we
could
get
a
new
ietf
wg
started
i
believe
that
we
should
instead
run
a
single
caida
working
group
on
network
metrics
rather
than
the
two
proposed
earlier
my
draft
of
its
charter
is
appended
below
it
focuses
on
producing
educational
material
about
network
measurement
and
on
developing
new
metrics
these
were
the
two
areas
of
greatest
interest
amongst
the
caida
members
the
wg
co
chairs
are

questions
from

draft
caida
wg
charters
a
what
types
of
network
and
transport
layer
metrics
are
being
used
by
isps
in
engineering
and
operating
their
networks
by
customers
for
verifying
service
guarantees
b
what
new
services
are
being
or
are
likely
to
be
offered
e
g
diffserv
is
there
a
need
for
higher
layer
metrics
to
better
monitor
and
manage
these
services
c
will
these
new
differentiated
transport
and
application
layer
services
need
new
metrics
d
how
can
the
service
metrics
be
measured
in
a
multi
isp
environment
e
how
can
customers
verify
these
measurements
f
what
requirements
would
service
measurement
introduce
for
equipment
vendors
g
how
relevant
are
specific
techniques
e
g
which
flow
and
points
of
measurement
to
specific
users
isp
customer
etc
requirements
h
how
do
these
metrics
relate
to
network
behavior
as
perceived
by
users
how
do
they
correlate
with
performance
appendix
b
background
on
the
ietf
working
groups
rtfm
wg
realtime
traffic
flow
measurement
rtfm
is
concerned
with
passive
measurements
of
two
way
traffic
flows
specified
in
terms
of
their
end
point
attributes
its
primary
goal
was
to
produce
an
improved
traffic
flow
measurement
model
considering
at
least
the
following
needs
a
wider
range
of
measurable
quantities
e
g
those
relating
to
ipv
and
to
class
of
service
b
simpler
ways
to
specify
flows
of
interest
c
better
ways
to
control
access
to
measured
flow
data
d
strong
focus
on
data
reduction
capabilities
e
efficient
hardware
implementation
ippm
wg
ip
performance
measurement
the
ippm
wg
charter
is
to
develop
a
set
of
standard
metrics
that
can
be
applied
to
the
quality
performance
and
reliability
of
internet
data
delivery
services
these
metrics
will
be
designed
such
that
they
can
be
performed
by
network
operators
end
users
or
independent
testing
groups
it
is
important
that
the
metrics
not
represent
a
value
judgement
i
e
define
good
and
bad
but
rather
provide
unbiased
quantitative
measures
of
performance

the
rmonmib
wg
is
thinking
about
application
performance
measurement
this
is
clearly
a
hard
problem
e
g
does
this
just
mean
response
time
measurement
can
it
be
done
by
passive
means
how
should
the
measurements
be
presented
etc
in
short
rtfm
provides
a
good
distributed
measuring
system
for
traffic
volumes
ippm
has
concentrated
on
transport
layer
behaviour
of
the
current
best
effort
internet
rmonmib
is
beginning
to
consider
application
layer
measurement
