light
switch
for
eb
good
morning
all
maureen
raymond
castaneda
is
officed
in
ebl
she
has
terrible
migraine
headaches
which
are
made
worse
by
light
we
would
like
to
get
a
price
on
having
an
on
off
switch
installed
in
her
room
as
of
now
they
have
removed
the
light
bulbs
but
said
that
may
not
completely
answer
the
problem
as
some
one
may
see
that
they
are
out
and
request
they
be
replaced
i
think
the
answer
if
it
is
not
too
expensive
would
be
to
have
a
switch
installed
please
let
me
know
our
co
is
and
our
rc
is
thanks
