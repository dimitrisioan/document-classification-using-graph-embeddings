hi
john

enjoyed
our
meeting
yesterday

looks
very
promising
meanwhile

i
mentioned
at
the
table
i
m
getting
a
little
nervous
about
the
book
that
is
due
june
one
of
the
names
on
our
wish
list
of
interviewees
for
the
business
of
heaven
is
ken
lay
at
enron

i
ll
try
to
get
this
for
you
today

it
be
possible
for
you
to
give
me
a
good
address
and
phone
number
for
mr
lay
s
office
and
may
i
mention
your
name
in
the
cover
letter
certainly
not
that

will
necessarily
help
i
ll
talk
to
the
director
of
research
about
your
project
and
see
if
he
can
help
i
would
be
forever
indebted

might
even
buy

next
lunch
