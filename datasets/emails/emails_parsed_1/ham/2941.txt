julie
unfortunately
our
reviewer
has
not
come
back
to
us
with
comments
so
i
am
sending
you
the
final
version
without
the
benefit
of
review
the
attached
zipped
file
contains
the
second
half
of
the
chapter
for
which
i
was
responsible
vince
will
send
you
his
half
separately
putting
them
together
should
be
a
simple
matter
of
cut
and
paste
assuming
that
vince
has
not
changed
his
equation
figure
or
table
numbering
i
presume
chris
will
be
reading
through
the
chapter
once
again
for
editorial
reasons
there
is
one
place
where
i
would
ask
him
for
specific
redaction
table
model
specifications
on
page
has
a
column
labeled
equation
reference
some
cells
are
blank
because
the
equations
specified
have
not
been
referenced
previously
in
the
parts
i
have
written
nevertheless
the
concepts
are
surely
introduced
elsewhere
in
the
book
and
it
may
be
helpful
for
chris
to
insert
the
appropriate
reference
in
this
table
alternatively
one
could
simply
delete
the
column
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
please
do
not
hesitate
