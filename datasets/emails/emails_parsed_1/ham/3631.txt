long
discussion

i
also
asked
if

spoken

but
that
was
a
non
starter

i
talked

after
we
hung
up
and
his
only
suggestion
was
to
call
sandeep
kohli
i
spoke
with
marc
and
yourself
four
times
on
this
matter
over
a
day
period
and
given
the
timing
i
put
forth
a
non
binding
offer
after
discussing
it
further
with
bobby
based
on
the
information
i
had
that
appears
to
position
us
close
to
our
competitors
offers
we
haven
t
committed
ourselves
and
should
we
be
selected
for
negotiations
there
are
numerous
variables
to
affect
the
outcome
if
you
ve
got
any
suggestions

a

i
strongly
disagree
with
the
pricing
and
structure
of
your
non

offer
to
cairn
this
reminds
me
of
the
debacle
in
brazil
you
should
have
contacted
vince
kaminski
s
research
group
as
we
talked
about
before
an
offer
was
made
this
is
a
bad

cairn
gas
purchase
bid
bobby
after
meeting
with
cairn
today
in
delhi
my
perception
is
that
our
offer
was
received
well
they
were
more
open
and
relaxed
then
they
were
on
wed
morning
and
made
several
encouraging
comments
about
our
price
range
once
we
talked
through
the
price
movements
and
the
seriousness
of
our
gas
related
activities
on
the
west
coast
of
india
in
light
of
the
ioc
agreement
i
think
the
overall
package
is
attractive
to
them
and
no
serious
objections
were
raised
we
did
talk
to
some
extent
about
the
guarantees
but
we
didn
t
get
too
far
and
they
re
willing
to
accept
at
this
point
that
what
s
acceptable
to
the
lng
suppliers
should
be
suitable
for
their
needs
however
they
would
like
to
understand
the
corporate
structure
and
assets
of
enron
energy
marketing
a
little
better
and
i
told
them
i
would
get
back
to
them
on
that
point
david
and
ajay
were
up
in
hazira
yesterday
looking
at
some
property
for
their
gas
treatment
facility
which
apparently
is
across
the
road
from
pipeline
access
while
there
they
went
and
looked
at
shell
s
proposed
lng
site
after
walking
the
last
km
inaccessible
to
their
wd
vehicle
and
not
surprisingly
found
a
beach
in
summary
here
is
what
we
offered
on
a
non
binding
basis
six
year
production
plateau
top
mmbtu
net
at
a
base
of
bbl
brent
with
point
of
sale
at
the
tail
end
of
the
gas
processing
plant
floor
cap
of
bbl
price
movement
bbl
from
the
bbl
base
price
on
a
mo
rolling
average
equals
mmbtu
fixed
on
a
quarterly
basis
guarantees
same
protection
we
re
providing
the
lng
suppliers
under
the
trust
retention
account
i
appreciate
everyone
s
help
in
submitting
this
offer
thanks
