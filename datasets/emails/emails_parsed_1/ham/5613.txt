re
full
version
i
read
the
chapter
generally
i
like
it
and
find
it
non
controversial
and
well
written
of
course
this
is
a
huge
topic
and
there
are
things
that
you
haven
t
discussed
i
thought
the
amount
of
attention
paid
to
ols
and
mle
estimation
was
a
bit
overboard
given
that
you
didn
t
really
exploit
it
in
your
results
if
you
were
to
state
the
likelihood
function
for
the
garch
model
it
might
justify
the
amount
of
attention
to
gave
to
estimation
for
simple
iid
processes
which
could
then
be
thought
of
as
a
simple
lead
in
and
intuition
builder
to
the
more
interesting
models
that
you
do
actually
use
by
the
way
in
your
discussion
of
smiles
you
discuss
fat
tails
extensively
at
least
for
equity
markets
while
fat
tails
contribute
they
don
t
do
very
much
at
all
compared
to
the
effect
of
risk
premia
which
you
allude
to
briefly
using
supply
demand
language
at
the
end
of
that
section
for
the
impact
of
risk
premia
see
jun
pan
s
paper
which
is
available
from
her
web
page
but
she
covers
only
sp
as
do
most
studies
and
your
markets
are
obviously
much
different
the
chapter
will
be
a
good
service
to
your
readers
