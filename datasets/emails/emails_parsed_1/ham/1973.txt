vince
i
have
made
bold
face
edits
to
the
attached
document
i
still
have
two
edits
to
make
but
am
concerned
that
you
were
not
reading
the
most
recent
version
sorry
for
any
confusion
but
the
editor
doesn
t
use
the
edit
function
in
word
so
i
have
ended
up
making
edits
on
new
versions
of
the
paper
i
still
haven
t
made
the
change
regarding
the
take
or
pay
problem
i
left
that
paper
at
home
in
my
briefcase
and
will
make
the
change
tomorrow
morning
also
i
haven
t
added
anything
regarding
the
conflict
that
arose
over
pay
for
new
hires
nor
have
i
received
the
business
week
e
mail
from
you
however
if
the
paper
looks
ok
to
mark
palmer
we
can
make
these
minor
edits
on
the
galley
pages
of
the
article
thanks
john
p
s
i
am
very
disappointed
about
the
scheduling
conflict
you
have
on
feb
rd
you
will
be
greatly
missed
but
i
certainly
understand
