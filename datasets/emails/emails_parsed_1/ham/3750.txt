your
colleagues
for
taking
the
time
to
video
conference
with
us
at

aa
professionals
associated
with

i
enjoyed
the

and
was
left
impressed
by
the
technical
savvy
and
keen
interest
in
research
on
part
of
enron
i
look
forward
to
hearing

as
i
recall
we
agreed
that
enron
would
forward
a
few
issues
questions
that

potentially
address
once
we
have
a
meeting
of
minds
on
the
set

discuss
further
how
best
to
collaborate

accomplish
our

believe

some
answers
