mr
kaminski
nick
perry
and
i
were
recently
discussing
the
conference
in
paris
and
we
gathered
that
you
had
some
interest
in
exploring
possible
uses
of
our
new
weatherdelta
tool
kit
it
is
the
only
application
that
we
know
of
that
can
model
temperature
loads
and
power
prices
in
several
locations
simultaneously
thus
allowing
the
user
to
measure
the
value
an
risk
in
a
variety
of
financial
instruments
physical
obligations
and
assets
i
have
attached
the
product
overview
sheet
and
would
be
happy
to
discuss
its
capabilities
with
you
at
your
convenience
nick
