authorization
for
its

copying
me
and

john
and

i
have
a
few
simple
comments
please
use
enron
corp
rather
than
enron
corporation
page
as
of
yesterday
fortune
magazine
named
enron
most
innovative
for
the
sixth
year
in
a
row
page
nd
paragraph
regarding
the
gas
bank
concept
i
believe
when
jeff
first
introduced
it
it
fell
flat
i
think
john
pick
s
that
up
and
enron
s
subsequent
recovery
of
a
version
of
the
concept
on
p
but
it
s
probably
accurate
to
mention
that
at
first
it
didn
t
go
over
page
re
cindy
olson
s
comment
on
a
possible
x
difference
between
a
satisfactory
and
superior
vp
the
difference
referred
to
is
probably
the
bonus
rather
than
compensation
which
to
me
is
generally
means
base
salary
also
it
varies
for
each
review
period
as
comparative
performance
might
vary
further
we
might
want
to
run
that
quote
by
cindy
just
to
make
sure
she
s
ok
with
it
s
publication
she
might
have
no
problem
with
it
whatsoever
but
i
know
for
other
articles
she
s
been
more
reluctant
to
provide
that
kind
of
statistic
page
after
annual
report
quote
i
suggest
changing
enron
s
wholesale
business
provides
to
businesses
provide
also
rather
than
enron
wholesale
we
might
want
to
define
this
by
the
term
enron
uses
enron
wholesale
services
page
nd
paragraph
the
tense
switching
from
past
to
present
is
technically
correct
if
read
carefully
but
seems
awkward
when
reading
it
page
effective
february
jeff
skilling
is
ceo
that
s
my
cents
worth
i
think
the
article
is
great
even
interesting
ha
even
to
non
mba
s
like
me
