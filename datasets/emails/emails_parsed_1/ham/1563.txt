hi
paul
cassim
further
to
our
meeting
yesterday
regarding
power
options
that
we
may
use
to
capture
short
term
volatility
from
regulatory
caps
being
adhered
to
or
broken
i
have
attached
a
spreadsheet
that
should
assist
in
nailing
down
the
value
arbitrary
distribution
the
first
issue
to
address
is
converting
the
price
scenarios
for
the
average
of
the
q
q
swap
into
a
volatility
equivalent
this
is
achieved
by
fitting
a
normal
distribution
that
matches
the
one
specified
for
mean
and
standard
deviation
the
graph
below
illustrates
the
method
for
the
numbers
discussed
yesterday
in
this
example
the
annualised
volatility
is
coming
up
as
approximately
pricing
implied
volatility
the
pricing
is
as
for
a
regular
asian
option
the
payoff
depends
on
the
average
of
the
daily
prices
for
spanish
power
for
q
and
q
the
valuation
using
volatility
is
showing
about
pta
per
kwh
i
will
schedule
a
meeting
to
allow
us
to
take
this
forward
