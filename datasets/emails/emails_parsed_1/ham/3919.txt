per
our
discussion
and
e
mails
i
am
suggesting
the

once
the

upon

technical
groups

issues

enron
research
team

days
will
be
to
provide
john

s
group
with
better
understanding
about
how
the
trading
markets
have
developed
in
general
and
energy
markets
in
particular
via
enron
i
e
how
the
sausage
was
made
likewise
john
s
group
will
provide
us
with
better
understanding
of
optical

original
suggestion
to

yeager
s
cabin
somewhere
up
in
colorado
mts

should
probably
let

other
places
any
suggestions

ravi
