molly
i
think
you
called
his
bluff
if
he
does
not
fax
a
copy
of
his
paycheck
stub
we
should
not
talk
to
him
he
never
talked
to
me
about
it
if
he
made
a
true
statement
about
his
compensation
he
should
have
no
reservations
about
sending
us
the
confirmation

i
left
you
a
voicemail
about
charles
shen
a
week
or
so
ago
but
wanted
to
follow
up
with
you
when
i
called
him
to
extend
our
offer
to
him
he
expressed
surprise
at
the
base
salary
offer
of
and
told
me
that
he
was
currently
earning
base
pay
in
the
amount
of
i
told
him
that
the
salary
figure
he
had
written
himself
on
the
application
was
but
he
insisted
that
he
had
made
an
error
and
that
it
should
have
been
i
asked
him
what
base
salary
he
was
looking
for
and
he
said
he
would
expect
at
least
a
increase
in
his
base
i
then
told
him
that
i
was
not
authorized
to
make
an
offer
above
our
initial
one
and
would
contact
you
and
get
back
to
him
i
called
him
later
that
afternoon
and
asked
him
to
fax
me
a
copy
of
his
last
paycheck
stub
so
that
we
could
minimize
the
confusion
about
his
base
pay
he
said
that
he
would
be
happy
to
do
so
but
i
never
received
the
fax
he
left
me
a
voicemail
message
during
the
evening
that
said
he
was
on
vacation
and
didn
t
have
access
to
the
pay
stubs
but
would
send
me
a
copy
when
he
returned
i
have
not
heard
from
him
since
and
wondered
if
he
had
contacted
you
if
not
would
you
want
to
get
together
to
discuss
our
next
step
i
ll
wait
to
hear
from
you
