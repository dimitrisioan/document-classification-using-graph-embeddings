assumptions
constant
cashflows
between
the
quoted
years
as
opposed
to
interpolating
swaps
which
distorts
the
curve
a
lot
this
explains
the
atrocious
look
of
the
raw
curve
it
is
then
smoothed
with
a
macro
which
anjam
wrote
mid
point
of
the
swaps
is
used
for
deriving
the
curve
discount
rate
is
libor
and
i
solve
for
the
coupon
rate
which
is
the
rpi
yoy
rate
the
above
is
solved
separately
for
each
quoted
period
e
g
yrs
yrs
and
rpi
rates
are
determined
for
the
incremental
portion
by
forecasting
rpi
in
the
above
method
we
are
able
to
lock
in
and
deliver
the
forecasted
levels
looking
forward
to
your
comments
and
seeing
you
in
london
