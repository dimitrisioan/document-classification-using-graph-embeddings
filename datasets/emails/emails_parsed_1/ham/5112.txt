krishna
i
have
received
two
additional
requests
for
help
from
ees
jeremy
blachman
called
and
asked
us
to
increase
very
significantly
the
level
of
our
support
of
ees
it
probably
makes
sense
to
set
up
a
meeting
with
jeremy
asap
and
discuss
specifics
you
me
and
it
probably
makes
sense
to
invite
marty
sunde
as
well
george
posey
called
and
asked
fro
help
with
statistical
sampling
of
dublin
customers
please
give

call
to
set
up
a
meeting
i
shall
call
you
