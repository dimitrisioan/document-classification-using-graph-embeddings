re
site
license
for
power
world
richard
et
al
under
the
new
electricity
trading
arrangments
neta
in
the
uk
and
looking
forward
i
think
it
will
be
increasingly
important
in
modelling
market
behaviour
and
transmission
related
costs
to
have
some
form
of
system
model
incorporating
opf
and
atc
therefore
in
principle
i
am
happy
to
support
option
and
to
pay
a
share
of
the
cost
however
before
i
commit
to
this
particular
package
i
would
like
to
be
comfortable
that
the
generic
powerworld
software
could
be
suitably
customised
to
capture
the
special
features
of
neta
i
understand
marco
verreschi
who
initiated
interest
from
our
end
is
pursuing
this
with
martin
lin
research
houston
however
due
to
commitments
next
week
and
my
desire
to
see
powerworld
in
action
etc
it
is
likely
to
be
the
following
week
before
he
and
i
can
say
lets
do
it

i
recommend
that
we
purchase
this
package
and
split
the
cost
ways
between
power
trading
desks
i
think
that
we
should
go
for
option
lance
cunningham
in
my
group
looked
at
this
software
package
and
found
it
very
useful
for
modeling
transmission
problems
please
feel
free
to
ask
him
for
technical
details
in
support
of
this
recommendation

we
have
three
options
to
increase
our
availability
across
enron
for
the
power
world
load
flow
software
option
upgrade
to
a
site
license
for
the
load
flow
software
only
price
this
would
give
all
of
enron
the
ability
to
perform
load
flows
but
not
determine
marginal
cost
or
available
transfer
capacity
atc
because
only
the
optimal
power
flow
opf
version
can
perform
that
task
option
site
license
for
the
load
flow
and
purchase
opf
package
for
walter
coffer
s
group
price
this
would
give
all
of
enron
the
ability
to
perform
load
flows
and
one
other
group
the
ability
to
determine
marginal
cost
and
atc
option
site
license

opf
