after
looking
into
the
transport
deals
for
nbpl
long
term
deal
i
think
i
figured
it
out
why
we
see
positive
fuel
p
l
for
deal
and
and
negative
fuel
p
l
for
deal
the
following
plot
shows
nymex
curve

of
for
short

moved
up
compared
to
that
of
while
the
long

p
l
the
transport
book
seems
to
be
correct
on
these
fuel
p
ls
another
point
worth
to
mention
is
that
the
fuel
cost
is
related
to
index
price
nymex
basis
index
premium
to
correctly
interpret
fuel
p

we
need
to
look
at
