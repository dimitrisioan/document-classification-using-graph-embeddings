the
airport
is
about
minutes
by
cab
from
the
office
smith
the
best
hotel
is
either
hyatt
regency
downtown
or
doubletree
downtown
it
is
important
to
emphasize
downtown
when
making
reservations
the
hotels
are
within
a
walking
distance
from
the
enron
building
we
can
make
reservations
for
dinner
around
in
a
resturant
within
minutes
by
car
from
the
hotel
by
the
way
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
reimburse
you
for
the
trip
related
expenses

yes
that
would
be
ideal
but
let
me
call
first
my
travel
agent
to
see
if
there
is
a
flight
that
would
satisfy
all
the
other
constraints
what
time
should
i
be
at
enron
on
thursday
and
how
far
is
the

or
friday
may
by

i
was
able
to
attract
a
top
new
student
to
work
on
the
project
the
other
one
for
the
coming
year
will
be
giuseppe
by
spending
the
summer
at
enron
he
will
be
in
a
position
to
bring
the
new
one
up
to
speed
and
create
an
intellectual
team
here
at
stanford
to
look
at
these
problems
i
must
move
ahead
soon
to
put
the
project
in
place

visit
to
enron
hello
vince
it
was
nice
seeing
you
at
stanford
and
many
thanks
for
the
lunch
we
had
together
i
really
enjoyed
our
discussions
both
at
the
technical
level
and
otherwise
i
promised
to
send
you
an
e
mail
regarding
possible
dates
for
a
visit
to
enron
i
delayed
it
for
a
week
till
my
schedule
was
clearer
let
s
see
if
we
can
get
a
match
with
your
schedule
mine
is
rather
terrible
friday
st
of
april
looks
good
but
april
rd
is
easter
sunday
so
that
may
make
it
difficult
for
some
people
at
enron
to
be
around
let
me
know
if
that
is
the
case
i
am
willing
to
visit
then
because
the
week
after
that
i
am
scheduled
to
be
in
japan
and
in
the
previous
weeks
i
am
all
committed
on
fridays
friday
th
of
may
is
the
next
possibility
but
this
probably
is
too
far
out
the
main
problem
is
that
i
am
operating
within
a
window
of
opportunity
for
attracting
top
students
for
this
research
this
window
closes
by
the
end
of
april
and
it
would
be
important
for
the
student
support
funds
to
be
in
place
then
so
that
i
can
make
hard
commitments
to
students
and
attract
top
talent
i
am
already
reviewing
files
of
students
who
have
approached
me
for
phd
advising
and
i
am
in
a
mode
of
doing
soft
commitments
to
star
level
students
to
get
this
research
and
its
potential
on
their
radar
screen
top
students
are
highly
sought
after
by
advisors
and
i
want
to
be
an
early
player
in
this
competition
does
my
visit
to
enron
have
to
happen
before
we
can
set
up
the
project
and
student
support
at
stanford
if
so
doing
it
before
the
end
of
april
is
important
for
getting
top
people
if
the
visit
can
happen
after
we
get
the
ball
rolling
then
we
can
schedule
it
in
may
i
assume
there
will
be
multiple
visits
both
ways
when
the
project
gets
going
please
let
me
know
what
you
think
best
regards
nick
