re
implementing
term
structure
of
correlations
for
power
tanya
while
there
is
seasonal
correlations
in
power
especially
for
np
and
sp
same
region
the
term
structure
of
correlations
can
be
input
however
the
same
correlation
structure
with
similar
periodicity
may
not
hold
between
np
and
say
rlb
neepool
though
one
would
imagine
that
relationship
would
still
be
seasonal
summer
winter
with
greater
noise
even
if
the
correlational
term
structure
is
to
be
done
for
power
different
rules
would
have
to
be
inputted
for
different
regions

vlady
correlations
are
periodic
with
a
period
of
year
this
means
we
can
use
correlation
matrices
calculated
from
first
forward
contracts
and
apply
these
matrices
to
other
forward
months
using
decay
factor
makes
the
curves
a
little
smoother
implementation
of
multiple
correlation
matrices
will
not
affect
the
speed
of
calculations
in
var
model
significantly
please
give
me
your
response
thanks
