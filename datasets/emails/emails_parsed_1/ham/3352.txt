invitation
to
present
at
risk
s
advanced
stress
testing
course
i
would
like
to
invite
you
to
present
a
section
on
risk
s
course
entitled
practical
application
of
advanced
stress
testing
which
will
be
held
in
london
february
and
new
york
february
you
have
been
recommended
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
research
as
an
authority
in
this
field
so
i
would
be
delighted
for
you
to
present
any
of
the
sections
that
are
still
available
on
the
attached
programme
for
london
sections
and
for
new
york
sections
and
my
market
research
indicates
that
advanced
stress
testing
is
a
highly
interesting
theme
for
a
wide
range
of
senior
quantitative
analysts
and
risk
managers
i
anticipate
the
course
to
be
technical
and
practical
in
nature
and
assume
a
high
level
of
knowledge
from
the
delegates
it
aims
to
extend
the
scope
of
accepted
practices
into
the
new
areas
of
liquidity
and
credit
risk
stress
testing
and
complement
var
methods
by
introducing
new
risk
measurement
techniques
that
can
be
applied
in
an
integrated
context
please
contact
me
as
soon
as
possible
with
an
indication
of
which
section
is
most
suitable
for
your
current
interests

not
be
able
