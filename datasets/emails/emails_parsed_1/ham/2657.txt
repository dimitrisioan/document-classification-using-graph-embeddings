s
new
weather
system
courtesy
the
research
dept
v
last
night
i
tested
our
new
system
for
real
time
surveillance
and
messaging
of
the
weather
and
it
delivers
the
data
to
desktops
throughout
the
building
more
than
minutes
before
the
national
weather
service
updates
their
webpages
our
current
technology
was
web
scraping
these
pages
via
ftp
then
parsing
into
a
database
the
impact
of
these
minutes
for
the
hourly
power
traders
is
enormous
the
weather
stations
upload
their
data
around
minutes
after
the
hour
and
we
can
now
receive
them
within
minutes
later
we
can
now
re
estimate
our
nonlinear
stack
model
before
the
top
of
the
hour
when
hourly
power
trading
begins
otherwise
we
would
not
have
model
results
until
around
minutes
after
the
hour
notably
hourly
power
trading
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
concluded
by
then
they
trade
for
minutes
and
manage
the
scheduling
for
the
next
or
so
miutes
so
effectively
we
may
now
be
one
hour
ahead
of
where
we
were
just
a
few
days
ago
in
terms
of
information
people
are
very
excited
up
here
from
the
cto
on
down
thanks
for
letting
it
happen
