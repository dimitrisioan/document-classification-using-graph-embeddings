completed
tomorrow
the

has
asked

data
across

for

leads
to
follow
up
on
elsa
in

asked
us
to
contact
some
of
the
softs
traders
here
and
let
them
know
once
we
were
up

running
contact
chris

additional
support
for

follow
up
on
a
potential
morning
breifing
for
continental
power
challenges
we
ve
been
told
that
we
will
be
moving
locations
next
week
which
might
entail
corrupting
or
loosing
the
software
and
hardware
configurations
that
have
taken
almost
a
week
to
get
fully
established
it
seems
that
this
office
functions
on
a
hot
desk
system
where
people
are
constantly
moving
around
this
will
make
it
very
difficult
to
stay
connected
as
well
as
very
difficult
for
our
customers
to
identify
us
administrative
detail
take
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
assembling
reports
both
physical
and
electronic
can
take
nearly
as
long
as
actually
preparing
the
reports
mike
ok
i
think
that
brings
you
up
to
speed
i
ve
been
amazed
at
the
amount
of
feedback
we
ve
already
gotten
and
we
ve
only
been
here
days
on
that
note
i
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
fully
committed
to
this
project
it
seems
that
we
will
not
have
a
second
meteorologist
to
assist
tony
by
my
planned
departure
date
on
the
th
as
such
i
can
continue
in
my
current
role
through
my
planned
vacation
keeping
me
in
london
until
the
th
which
is
my
current
reservation
back
to
houston
i
am
also
open
to
remaining
in
london
beyond
the
th
to
ensure
the
success
of
this
project
hopefully
this
gives
you
a
good
idea
as
to
what
s
gone
on
in
the
first
few
days
here
we
look
forward
to
talking
to
you
later
today
and
with
you
and
vince
tomorrow
