in
broomfield
co
on
march
and
hi
stinson
as
per
our
discussion
which
we
will
expand
upon
when
we
meet
later
today
my
currently
role
in
hamachi
is
better
characterize
as
combination
of
deal
support
from
the
engineering
perpsective
facilitating
my
work
with
jean
mrha
via
erik
simpson
on
the
initial
load
forecast
and
general
requirements
document
development
none
of
this
is
technical
by
any
means
if
anything
it
is
more
like
engineering
consulting
from
deal
perspective
by
ebs
research
to
john
s
group
i
will
bring
it
up
with
john
tomorrow
night
about
bringing
our
technical
guys
on
such
road
trips
so
that
they
can
get
involved
with
his
group
even
though
no
optimization
modeling
work
may
need
to
be
done
for
this
i
will
use
samer
and
or
chonawee
but
we
need
to
be
certain
that
they
are
available
on
such
on
call
basis
as
stated
below
john
is
very
clear
and
specific
about
who
he
ask
to
be
at
such
meeting
and
when
etc
normally
he
does
not
want
any
deviations
so
if
we
put
someone
on
such
jobs
they
have
to
be
able
to
travel
on
call
anywhere
any
place
that
is
the
time
pressure
he
is
working
with
he
want
me
to
be
the
primary
contact
for
such
deal
support
effort
but
i
will
ask
to
bring
along
our
technical
guys
on
such
trips
so
that
they
are
plugged
in
etc
i
will
recommend
this
to
john
for
the
next
deal
that
he
is
planning
