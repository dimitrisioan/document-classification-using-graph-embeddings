we
can
use
moment
matching
to
find
the
effective
volatility
and
dividend
yield
for
the
average
then
we
can
apply
the
european
digital
option
formula
attached
please
find
the
c
code
i
did
for
asian
spread
option
when
i
find
the
effective
vol
and
drift
for
both
averages
then
find
the
option
value
by
calling
the
european
spread
option
you
can
do
just
the
same
for
the
asian
digital
option
it
would
be
nice
to
do
a
monte
carlo
just
checking
the
accuracy
of
the
approximation
it
was
nice
to
have
you
here
we
are
impressed
by
the
work
you
have
done
keep
up
the
good
work

hi
zimin
russell
placket
of
mg
metals
just
talked
to
me
about
the
issue
of
pricing
a
strip
of
twelve
monthly
asian
digital
options
on
lme
aluminium
as
i
understand
the
payoff
to
the
customer
is
a
fixed
cash
amount
that
wil
be
paid
if
the
average
of
the
closing
prices
of
aluminium
for
a
month
are
greater
than
the
strike
agreed
in
advance
where
holiday
days
do
not
contribute
to
the
average
russell
mentioned
that
this
would
be
a
set
of
monthly
options
starting
in
jan
and
that
the
lme
price
for
jan
of
which
is
the
future
converging
to
the
spot
price
on
the
rd
wednesday
in
jan
can
be
used
as
a
proxy
estimate
for
the
average
for
the
month
do
you
have
a
model
for
asian
digitals
or
should
i
proceed
with
monte
carlo
to
price
this
maybe
using
european
digital
option
model
as
control
variate
thanks
