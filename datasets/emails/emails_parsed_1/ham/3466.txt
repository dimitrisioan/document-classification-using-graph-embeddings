var
transaction
policy
hey
you
guys
we
are
trying
to
implement
a
var
transaction
policy
and
would
like
your
opinion
this
is
going
to
be
tough
because
i
m
not
sure
we
have
implemented
a
similiar
policy
across
any
of
our
other
books
that
is
we
looking
to
bring
in
all
the
accrual
operational
assets
as
well
as
the
mtm
stuff
lambdas
to
have
a
real
live
configuration
of
the
system
if
assets
routes
servers
etc
are
added
what
is
the
impact
on
the
value
of
the
system
and
what
it
s
worth
john
has
attached
a
draft
below
for
your
review
and
thoughts
i
can
see
how
this
works
in
a
trading
environment
when
you
actually
know
the
var
of
your
whole
trading
portfolio
however
i
ve
not
seen
this
done
with
a
mixture
of
mtm
accrual
assets
add
the
spice
of
a
operational
system
valuation
and
this
will
be
tough
to
quantify
and
model
step
configure
system
and
value
it
step
calculate
a
var
on
this
we
will
need
to
do
some
work
here
step
calculate
the
incremental
var
of
new
deals
amendements
reconfigs
etc
tough
see
what
you

policies
here
is
a
first
rough
draft
of
a
value
risk
transaction
policy
i
would
like
you
to
start
looking
at
where
we
are
going
on
the
policy
and
get
some
early
thinking
going
on
limits
for
the
v
r
for
example
should
we
effectively
shut
down
all
server
relocations
without
approval
or
allow
some
level
of
mb
of
storage
to
be
moved
around
or
reconfigured
i
need
some
commercial
and
industry
realism
for
this
we
may
need
rick
paiste
or
your
industry
helpers
marquardt
etc
to
help
us
barry
lou
i
need
your
input
