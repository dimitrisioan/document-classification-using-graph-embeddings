bill
and
mark
the
figure
below
shows
you
what
happens
when
we
simulate
forward
prices
using
current
methodology
of
our
credit
reserve
model
the
time
scale
on
this
figure
goes
from
to
years
i
started
with
gas
prices
at
time
and
used
the
ng
forward
volatility
curve
which
has
volatilities
in
the
front
and
vols
for
long
term
contracts
you
can
see
from
the
figure
that
for
example
at
years
horizon
the
price
will
be
more
than
with
probability
but
less
than
with
probability
the
corresponding
lower
bounds
are
and

re
gbm
vs
reversion
both
seem
to
provide
fairly
unrealistic
values
gas
over
the
term
seems
improbable
however
a
gas
peak
does
not
represent
capture
all
potential
price
movement
at
confience
interval
what
were
your
assumptions
on
price
curves
volatilty

and
