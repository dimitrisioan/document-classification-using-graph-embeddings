projected
fund
giving
george
here
is
one
statistical
method
linear
regression
applied
to
hosanna
s
fund
giving
the
method
is
deterministic
where
contributions
each
sunday
are
attempted
to
be
explained
by
significant
events
on
the
church
s
and
members
calendars
and
the
method
shoudl
be
considered
in
contrast
to
an
anecdotal
one
where
each
sunday
s
giving
might
be
estimated
to
be
the
average
giving
of
the
same
sunday
e
g
each
nd
sunday
in
january
in
the
past
the
following
effects
are
estimated
independently
by
the
computer
they
add
and
subtract
with
each
other
accordingly
some
sundays
can
have
more
than
one
effect
in
play
most
positive
for
giving
an
additional
for
special
pastoral
appeals
of
them
in
the
past
years
positive
for
giving
an
additional
easter
and
nearest
christmas
sunday
an
additional
thanksgiving
sunday
and
a
tiny
additional
each
week
pure
time
trend
negative
for
giving
for
sundays
of
monday
federal
holiday
weekends
and
during
the
summer
june
aug
wave
there
is
an
per
week
wave
giving
higher
one
week
lower
the
next
etc
the
computer
can
explain
roughly
of
the
absolute
variation
in
giving
the
past
years
using
this
approach
keep
in
mind
much
of
the
information
statistically
is
captured
in
the
pastoral
appeals
easter
and
christmas
sundays
and
holiday
weekends
the
rest
of
the
variation
can
not
be
explained
by
this
simple
model
i
e
it
looks
like
noise
here
are
the
predictions
for
fund
giving
for
the
upcoming
year
you
can
cut
and
paste
these
numbers
to
any
file
or
spreadsheet
you
like
they
may
seem
boring
to
you
please
remember
they
are
the
deterministic
components
of
a
process
that
involves
a
lot
of
volatility
and
your
church
s
actual
experience
will
predictably
be
volatile
these
numbers
are
as
if
the
means
of
experiences
dependent
on
the
standard
deviations
