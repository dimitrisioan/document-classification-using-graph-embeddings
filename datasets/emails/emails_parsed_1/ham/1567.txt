via
satellite
i
have
attached
a
background
piece
to
brief
oil
traders
on
this
subject
prior
to
a
possible
meeting
with
them
please
give
me
any
comments
on
accuracy
completeness
and
coverage
of
the
areas
we
want
to
explore
as
a
side
note
i
found
some
info
on
the
web
stating
current
proven
oil
reserves
are
billion
bbls
discovery
of
a
billion
bbl
field
would
add
only
while
we
will
pursue
the
trading
advantage
option
it
is
not
looking
promising
that
it
has
great
short
term
value
given
the
long
time
frame
and
high
cost
of
bringing

reserves
to
market
