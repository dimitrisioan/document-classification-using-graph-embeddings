texas
cindy
you
may
or
may
not
remember
that
i
sent
a
short
note
to
you
last
may
outlining
a
fundraising
effort
for
the
hansford
county
library
in
spearman
texas
the
community
was
challenged
to
raise
which
i
offered
to
match
to
with
enron
foundations
employee
match
this
grows
to
a
total
mathching
ratio
of
for
every
raised
by
the
community
of
course
because
of
the
year
limit
i
have
to
spread
my
gifts
over
several
years
in
order
to
get
the
total
amount
matched
by
enron
sherry
benton
the
librarian
in
spearman
just
called
and
gave
me
the
great
news
that
the
in
community
donations
has
been
achieved
in
fact
i
expect
that
the
total
community
number
will
come
to
almost
once
all
of
the
donations
are
received
in
order
to
recognize
our
part
in
all
this
the
mayor
of
the
town
is
planning
to
declare
october
th
as
stinson
gibner
and
enron
day
in
spearman
and
they
would
like
to
have
some
public
ceremony
to
bestow
this
recognition
there
will
be
coverage
by
the
local
radio
station
and
newspaper
and
possibly
by
the
amarillo
newspaper
as
well
they
are
asking
if
a
representative
from
enron
other
than
myself
would
be
interested
in
coming
to
spearman
for
this
event
please
let
me
know
if
you
or
anyone
else
would
be
interested
in
doing
this
spearman
is
about
a
minute
drive
north
from
the
airport
in
amarillo
and
it
is
possible
to
get
there
and
back
to
houston
on
the
same
day
thanks

years

i
just
received
notification
of
enron
s
match
of
my
donation
to
the
hansford
county
library
in
spearman
texas
all
old
pipeline
hands
know
spearman
because
both
northern
natural
and
transwestern
pipelines
run
near
by
the
city
you
may
be
interested
to
know
what
i
am
trying
to
accomplish
there
the
library
is
one
of
the
few
independent
public
libraries
in
the
state
of
texas
as
it
is
owned
neither
by
the
county
nor
city
it
s
budget
is
met
through
a
combination
of
city
county
and
private
contributions
a
big
part
of
their
income
comes
from
the
thrift
shop
spearman
s
version
of
the
blue
bird
circle
in
order
to
help
the
library
continue
to
provide
quality
services
to
the
community
our
library
in
spearman
population
is
by
all
accounts
much
better
than
the
one
in
nearby
perryton
population
i
am
trying
to
help
the
library
establish
an
endowment
fund
we
have
set
a
goal
of
raising
over
the
next
years
with
enron
s
matching
i
am
planning
to
provide
about
of
that
amount
with
the
other
coming
from
contributions
from
others
in
the
local
community
i
am
also
investigating
if
the
library
can
get
any
type
of
matching
grant
from
other
foundations
but
it
looks
like
most
prefer
to
fund
specific
projects
rather
than
put
funds
towards
endowments
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
suggestions
for
us
thanks
