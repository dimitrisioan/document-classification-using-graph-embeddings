re
lloyd
yes
this
would
be
very
useful
i
was
told
that
we
should
not
do
any
official
business
with
mg
until
july
i
don
t
want
to
violate
those
rules
of
engagement
and
go
beyond
casual
contacts
after
the
th
all
the
stops
are
off
vince
from
lloyd
fleming

to

ect
cc
subject
re
no
problem
i
do
think
this
could
wait
until
mg
are
more
closely
integrated
in
any
case
a
useful
first
step
might
be
an
email
to
relevant
trading
staff
at
mg
outlining
briefly
what
maureen
does
and
how
she
can
provide
a
service
to
them
would
you
like
me
to
send
her
a
list
of
potential
people
to
email

re

i
think
that
we
can
arrange
a
few
video
conference
meetings
instead
i
don
t
see
a
justification
for
extending
the
stay
over
the
weekend
if
we
have
an
alternative
solution

i
met
maureen
yesterday
and
had
a
useful
discussion
on
her
role
within
enron
i
think
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
promote
the
research
group
function
of
the
company
particularly
given
maureen
s
background
if
she
could
be
introduced
to
some
of
the
main
traders
down
at
mg
unfortunately
she
won
t
have
time
to
meet
with
mg
unless
we
can
schedule
some
meetings
on
monday
would
you
be
happy
for
her
to
extend
her
stay
here
till
monday
to
allow
the
meetings
to
take
place
