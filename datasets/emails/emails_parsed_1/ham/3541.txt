we
are
currently
not
modelling
the
effect
of
insurance
on
eastern
on
an
individual
risk
basis
i
have
spoken
at
length
with
houston
research
credit
risk
management
on
this
given
that
the
portfolio
of
risk
is
dynamic
specific
allocation
of
protection
is
not
appropriate
as
i
mentioned
in
my
earlier
message
there
is
mm
cap
on
any
one
loss
assuming
no
losses
have
occured
prior
to
that
i
am
happy
to
discuss
this
further
with
you
if
required

the

is
not
a
fixed
allocation
of
protection
to
individual
counterparties

covers
the
global
portfolio

enron
has
in
place
tranches
of
credit
insurance
covering
up

mm

event

the
insurance
is

loss
on

had
not
been
incurred
prior

i
have
already
discussed
with
houston
credit
risk
management
at

point
