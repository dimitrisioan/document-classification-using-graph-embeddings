you

any
questions
please
contact

at
bridge
loan
financing
bills
may
not
meet
their
may
th
deadline
due
to
lack
of
support
sources
report
there
will
not
be
a
vote
regarding
the
authorization
for
the
bond
issuance
bridge
loan
by
the
may
th
deadline
any
possibility
for
a
deal
has
reportedly
fallen
apart
according
to
sources
both
the
republicans
and
democratic
caucuses
are
turning
against
davis
the
democratic
caucus
is
reportedly
unwilling
to
fight
for
davis
many
legislative
republicans
and
democrats
reportedly
do
not
trust
davis
and
express
concern
that
once
the
bonds
are
issued
to
replenish
the
general
fund
davis
would
double
dip
into
the
fund
clearly
there
is
a
lack
of
good
faith
between
the
legislature
and
the
governor
however
it
is
believed
once
davis
discloses
the
details
of
the
power
contracts
negotiated
a
bond
issuance
will
take
place
additionally
some
generator
sources
have
reported
that
some
of
the
long
term
power
contracts
as
opposed
to
those
still
in
development
require
that
the
bond
issuance
happen
by
july
if
not
the
state
may
be
in
breach
of
contract
sources
state
that
if
the
legislature
does
not
pass
the
bridge
loan
legislation
by
may
th
having
a
bond
issuance
by
july
lst
will
be
very
difficult
the
republicans
were
planning
to
offer
an
alternative
plan
whereby
the
state
would
eat
the
billion
cost
of
power
spent
to
date
out
of
the
general
fund
thereby
decreasing
the
amount
of
the
bond
issuance
to
approximately
billion
however
the
reportedly
now
are
not
going
to
offer
even
this
concession
sources
report
that
the
republicans
intend
to
hold
out
for
full
disclosure
of
the
governor
s
plan
for
handling
the
crisis
including
the
details
and
terms
of
all
long
term
contracts
he
has
negotiated
before
they
will
support
the
bond
issuance
to
go
forward
currently
there
are
two
bills
dealing
with
the
bridge
loan
ab
x
and
ab
x
ab
x
authorizes
the
dwr
to
sell
up
to
billion
in
bonds
this
bill
passed
the
senate
in
march
but
has
stalled
in
the
assembly
due
to
a
lack
of
republican
support
ab
x
deals
with
energy
conservation
programs
for
community
college
districts
however
sources
report
this
bill
may
be
amended
to
include
language
relevant
to
the
bond
sale
by
senator
bowen
currently
in
ab
x
senator
bowen
s
language
states
that
the
state
should
get
paid
before
the
utilities
from
rate
payments
which
if
passed
would
be
likely
to
cause
a
socal
bankruptcy
according
to
sources
close
to
the
republicans
in
the
legislature
republicans
do
not
believe
there
should
be
a
bridge
loan
due
to
money
available
in
the
general
fund
for
instance
tony
strickland
has
stated
that
only
of
the
bonds
or
approximately
billion
should
be
issued
other
republicans
reportedly
do
not
support
issuing
any
bonds
the
republicans
intend
to
bring
this
up
in
debate
on
monday
additionally
lehman
brothers
reportedly
also
feels
that
a
bridge
loan
is
unnecessary
and
there
are
some
indications
that
lehman
may
back
out
of
the
bridge
loan

at
bill
sb
x
passed
the
senate
yesterday
but
little
can
be
done
at
this
time
the
senate
passed
sb
x
yesterday
which
authorizes
billion
to
create
the
california
consumer
power
and
conservation
authority
the
billion
authorized
under
sb
x
is
not
the
same
as
the
billion
that
must
be
authorized
by
the
legislature
to
pay
for
power
already
purchased
or
the
additional
amount
of
bonds
that
must
be
authorized
to
pay
for
purchasing
power
going
forward
again
the
republicans
are
not
in
support
of
these
authorizations
without
the
details
of
the
long
term
power
contracts
the
governor
has
negotiated
the
republicans
do
not
know
what
the
final
bond
amount
is
that
must
be
issued
and
that
taxpayers
will
have
to
pay
to
support
no
further
action
can
be
taken
regarding
the
implementation
of
sb
x
until
it
is
clarified
how
and
when
the
state
and
the
utilities
get
paid
for
purchasing
power
also
there
is
no
staff
defined
purpose
etc
for
the
california
public
power
and
conservation
authority
however
this
can
be
considered
a
victory
for
consumer
advocates
who
began
promoting
this
idea
earlier
in
the
crisis
socal
edison
and
bankruptcy
at
this
point
two
events
would
be
likely
to
trigger
a
socal
bankruptcy
the
first
would
be
a
legislative
rejection
of
the
mou
between
socal
and
the
governor
the
specified
deadline
for
legislative
approval
of
the
mou
is
august
th
however
some
decision
will
likely
be
made
earlier
according
to
sources
the
state
has
yet
to
sign
the
mou
with
socal
though
socal
has
signed
it
the
republicans
are
against
the
mou
in
its
current
form
and
davis
and
the
senate
lack
the
votes
needed
to
pass
if
the
legislature
indicates
that
it
will
not
pas
the
mou
socal
would
likely
file
for
voluntary
bankruptcy
or
its
creditor
involuntary
due
to
the
lack
operating
cash
the
second
likely
triggering
event
which
is
linked
directly
to
the
bond
issuance
would
be
an
effort
by
senator
bowen
to
amend
sb
x
bridge
loan
stating
that
the
dwr
would
received
of
its
payments
from
ratepayers
then
the
utilities
would
receive
the
residual
amount
in
other
words
the
state
will
get
paid
before
the
utilities
if
this
language
is
included
and
passed
by
the
legislature
it
appears
likely
that
socal
will
likely
file
for
bankruptcy
socal
is
urging
the
legislature
to
pay
both
the
utilities
and
the
dwr
proportionately
from
rate
payments
