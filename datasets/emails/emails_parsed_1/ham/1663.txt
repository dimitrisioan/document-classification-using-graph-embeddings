everyone
should
read
the
attached
risk
article
about
calculating
def
probs
from
cds
quotes
amazingly
it
is
in
pretty
close
agreement
with
our
own
methodology
for
both
cds
valuation
and
reverse
engineering
def
probs
the
only
extension
in
the
reverse
engineering
is
that
instead
of
linearly
interpolating
cds
quotes
they
propose
minimising
an
error
measure
based
on
smoothness
of
def
prob
curve
and
difference
between
model
and
market
prices
what
is
also
amazing
is
the
fact
that
this
article
has
been
published
in
risk
given
that
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
my
credit
pricing
paper
plus
one
excellent
idea
given
extra
time
resources
and
brainpower
there
is
no
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
have
similar
work
published
ourselves
