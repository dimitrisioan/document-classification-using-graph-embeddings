your

rusty
parks
who
is
an
mba

here
and
has
been
serving
as
my
research

since
last

a
very
outstanding
individual
with
a
very
impressive
work
ethic
and
interest
in
topics
such
as
financial
engineering
and
technology
particularly
as
these
issues
pertain
to
the
energy
industry
in
fact
you
met
rusty
during
your
recent
visit
to
baylor
specifically
last
month
over
dinner
at
the
gamma
iota
sigma
chartering
ceremony

visit
enron
for
an
interview
for
a
summer

been
invited

is
any
possibility
that
you

meet
with
him
during

i
am
sure
that
he
would
be
most
grateful
rusty
is
one
of
the
very
best
research
assistants
i
have
ever
had
and
i

sure
