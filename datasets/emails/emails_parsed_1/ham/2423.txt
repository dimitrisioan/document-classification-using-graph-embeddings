asset
swaps
vs
cds
s
john
i
haven
t
had
much
time
to
put
something
together
on
this
issue
fundamentally
both
instruments
represent
the
same
credit
risk
i
e
same
credit
events
and
contingent
payments
both
represent
senior
unsecured
credit
risk
the
differences
in
pricing
therefore
arise
purely
from
supply
and
demand
one
would
expect
generally
that
the
asset
swap
would
be
lower
than
the
cds
because
of
liquidity
there
are
only
so
many
bonds
out
there
and
so
demand
for
asset
swaps
is
limited
i
am
attaching
a
one
page
note
by
jp
morgan
where
they
claim
that
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
the
cds
to
be
more
expensive
is
people
hedging
convertible
bonds
by
combining
a
call
option
on
the
equity
and
a
cds
if
the
call
is
cheap
they
will
be
willing
to
pay
more
for
the
cds
driving
the
price
up
i
ll
try
to
synthesize
something
more
complete
next
week
cheers
