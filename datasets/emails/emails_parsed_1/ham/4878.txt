please
ignor
my
previous
mail
regarding
the
same
issue
which
contains
some
typos
greg
and
john
i
found
that
by
reducing
the
volume
per
trade
and
increasing
daily
number
of
trades
keeping
the
total
volume
per
day
constant
we
can
be
more
profitable
this
is
partially
because
in
a
trending
market
we
lose
less
money
by
following
the
market
more
closely
for
example
suppose
market
move
from
to
if
per
trade
volume
is
bbl
and
the
half
bid
offer
spread
is
for
simplicity
we
take
trades
of
short
positions
the
total
mtm
for
that
day
is
and
total
trading
volume
is
bbl
short
if
per
trade
volume
is
bbl
we
take
one
trade
the
total
mtm
is
thus
the
net
difference
between
the
two
trading
strategies
is
for
that
particular
day
therefore
it
seems
that
by
reducing
per
trade
volume
and
increasing
the
number
of
trades
we
can
be
more
profitable
as
a
market
maker
i
rerun
a
scenario
that
stinson
sent
to
you
on
dec
where
he
used
per
trade
volume
of
bbl
i
reduce
the
number
of
trade
to
while
increasing
the
number
of
trades
by
factor
of
almost
in
all
cases
i
saw
increased
profitability
see
the
colume
marked
change
for
dollar
amount
change
in
millions
please
let
stinson
or
me
know
your
thoughts
on
this
