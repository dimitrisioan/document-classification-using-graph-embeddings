and
i
feel
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
constrained
optimization
routine
for
our
var
related
research
numerical
recipes
does
not
contain
subroutines
where
equality
and
inequality
contraints
can
be
easily
incorporated
also
the
number
of
arguments
that
can
be
handled
is
also
limited
imsl
provides
a
comprehensive
library
of
more
than
c
c
statistical
and
mathematical
analysis
functions
we
think
that
it
would
be
of
great
value
to
our
efforts
and
to
the
efforts
of
our
research
group
presently
the
cost
is
aproximately
around
and
mike
bothwell
visual
numerics
rep
assures
us
as
the
version
is
not
license
protected
we
all
can
use
it
as
long
as
simultaneous
usage
is
within
the
license
please
let
me
know
if
you
should
need
further
information
thanks

rakesh
as
we
discussed
the
cnl
pc
libraries
are
not
license
managed
version
will
be
the
pc
version
can
be
installed
on
a
network
drive
and
called
from
networked
pcs
as
expected
we
would
ask
that
enron
honor
the
license
agreement
by
allowing
only
the
number
of
simultaneous
uses
permitted
by
the
license
version
will
be
license
managed
and
can
be
licensed
as
node
locked
or
floating
with
regard
to
unix
licensing
the
current
version
of
cnl
for
unix
is
license
managed
it
can
be
licensed
as
node
locked
or
floating
if
you
install
the
libraries
on
a
unix
server
as
node
locked
the
number
of
simultaneous
sessions
on
that
server
is
not
limited
except
by
the
capabilities
of
the
machine
a
floating
unix
license
would
be
checked
out
by
the
individual
user
to
be
executed
on
a
local
machine
also
as
mentioned
your
investment
is
protected
by
allowing
you
to
upgrade
in
the
future
by
paying
only
the
price
difference
between
your
current
and
desired
platforms
this
upgrade
option
only
applies
to
licenses
covered
under
support
if
you
have
any
additional
questions
please
let
me
know
i
look
forward
to
providing
you
the
best
math
and
statistical
libraries
available
today
to
help
you
solve
your
problems
and
understand
your
data
