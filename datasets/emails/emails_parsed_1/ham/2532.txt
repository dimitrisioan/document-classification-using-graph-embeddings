we
would
like
to
go
ahead
with
an
offer
to
kenneth
after
talking
to
him
again
i
think
he
will
accept
we
would
like
to
offer
him
the
equivalent
package
to
an
incoming
associate
which
i
understand
would
be
k
base
and
a
signing
bonus
of
k
he
position
would
be
a
specialist
or
senior
specialist
whichever
fits
the
salary
