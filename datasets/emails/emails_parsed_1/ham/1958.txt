re
stressing
correlations
hi
everybody
following
up
on
our
discussions
on
stressing
correlations
i
made
a
spreadsheet
and
a
dll
here
is
what
it
does
in
the
input
main
sheet
the
user
has
to
specify
the
size
of
the
correlation
matrix
the
row
and
column
for
the
element
he
wants
to
stress
row
and
col
in
the
example
the
integer
number
n
iter
the
original
correlation
matrix
in
the
output
see
sheet
results
we
see
columns
the
first
column
contains
possible
correlation
values
from
to
n
iter
numbers
for
the
element
the
second
column
contains
the
smallest
eigenvalue
for
the
stressed
correlation
matrix
which
is
the
same
as
the
original
matrix
except
the
elements
and
which
take
values
from
to
thus
the
user
can
see
which
values
for
the
chosen
element
are
permitted
those
for
which
the
smallest
eigenvalue
is
positive
marked
green
in
the
example
the
user
might
decide
that
he
wants
to
assign
the
correlation
which
is
not
permitted
to
this
particular
element
the
smallest
eigenvalue
is
negative
then
the
user
might
have
a
few
options
all
the
elements
of
the
correlation
matrix
will
be
modified
so
that
the
chosen
element
has
the
desired
correlation
in
it
but
the
change
in
the
correlation
matrix
is
the
smallest
possible
in
the
sense
of
matrix
norm
this
is
my
next
step
to
do
for
this
spreadsheet
just
one
column
and
the
corresponding
row
of
course
will
change
while
the
rest
of
the
matrix
will
stay
unchanged
kevin
s
suggestion
in
this
case
the
user
have
to
choose
which
column
and
row
he
prefers
to
modify
in
my
example
column
row
or
column
row
we
can
discuss
this
approach
with
risk
control
and
see
how
they
like
it
i
send
you
only
the
spreadsheet
with
an
example
now
