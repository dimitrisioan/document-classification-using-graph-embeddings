approaches
tcf
per

demand
for
natural
gas
storage
capacity
will
rise
exponentially
although
the
snowball
has
just
started
rolling
current
plans
by
natural
storage
operators
will
boost
working
capacity
by
bcf

and
will
raise

research
package
provides
a
comprehensive
look
at
all
current
activity
on
storage
fields
with
additional
key
information
on
lng
facilities
among
them
are
proposed
natural
gas
storage
fields
and
storage
expansion
projects
depleted
fields
capture
the
largest
share
of
the
proposed
fields
with
followed
by
aquifers
with
six
and
salt
domes
and
salt
beds
with
four
each
altogether
the
proposed
new
fields
account
for
about
bcf
in
working
capacity
and
bcf
per
day
in
deliverability
proposed
and
potential
expansions
represent
an
increase
of
about
bcf
of
working
capacity
and
bcf
per
day
in
deliverability
but
these
projects
are
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
regulatory
changes
shifting
natural
gas
flows
and
increases
in
demand
due
to
growth
in
the
economy
and
particularly
in
natural
gas
fired
power
generation
are
expected
to
cause
significant
additional
storage
growth
in
the
next
decade
