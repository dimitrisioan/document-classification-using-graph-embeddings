re
my
son
kristin
i
think
that
we
have
done
enough
for
this
guy
all
we
can
do
is
to
give
somebody
a
chance
the
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
thanks
for
all
your
help
and
your
efforts

re
my
son
vince
i
left
a
message
with
one
of
yaron
s
roommates
on
thursday
afternoon
for
him
to
call
asap
for
an
interview
on
sunday
i
guess
he
took
the
wrong
number
down
but
i
do
not
understand
this
because
the
roommate
read
the
number
back
to
me
and
it
was
correct
when
i
did
not
hear
from
yaron
i
called
on
friday
and
left
a
voice
mail
with
my
cell
and
office
numbers
i
still
did
not
hear
from
him
and
called
again
yesterday
morning
i
finally
received
a
call
at
pm
yesterday
but
by
that
time
my
team
and
myself
were
half
way
back
to
houston
sorry
it
did
not
work
out
i
have
a
call
into
charlene
jackson
as
to
how
she
wants
me
to
proceed
and
i
will
get
back
with
you

my
son
vince
apparently
the
recruiter
spoke
to
one
of
my
son
s
roommates
and
left
a
phone
number
which
he
tried
several
times
and
got
busy
signals
today
she
called
just
before
you
called
me
and
left
her
cellphone
number
but
he
was
in
classes
all
morning
and
got
the
message
in
the
afternoon
i
really
appreciate
your
going
out
of
your
way
to
help
perhaps
there
will
be
another
opportunity
