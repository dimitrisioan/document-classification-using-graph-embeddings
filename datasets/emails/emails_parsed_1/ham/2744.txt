meeting
hi
vince
maybe
you
remember
me
my
name
is
andrew
miles
and
we
worked
together
on
a
speech
for
jeff
skilling
this
past
july
i
am
hoping
that
i
can
get
on
your
calendar
for
minutes
next
week
i
have
been
working
with
other
enron
employees
for
the
past
months
developing
a
comprehensive
innovation
acceleration
process
for
use
by
potentially
all
enron
employees
and
we
would
really
appreciate
your
input
we
have
presented
the
idea
to
quite
a
few
people
in
the
company
and
some
outside
of
the
company
strategos
institute
all
of
which
have
really
liked
the
idea
and
provided
key
input
many
people
have
suggested
that
we
run
the
idea
by
you
if
you
have
some
time
next
week
would
you
mind
allowing
me
to
explain
our
ideas
to
you
i
will
follow
up
with
a
telephone
call
all
the
best
andrew
