re
seeking
opportunity
in
computational
finance
dear
vince
thanks
for
your
response
i
am
not
a
programmer
nor
a
quant
i
am
an
expert
in
excel
and
otherwise
have
advanced
skills
in
the
remaining
msoffice
suite
beyond
that
i
have
extensive
experience
working
with
research
and
computer
progamming
personnel
on
projects
from
networks
to
databases
and
in
particular
automation
for
instance
the
first
generation
of
the
risk
analytics
system
that
i
designed
for
quantlab
was
done
in
excel
in
subsequent
generations
of
the
system
excel
served
only
as
the
gui
given
its
extreme
flexibility
and
a
sql
database
operated
underneath
compaq
servers
raid
array
integrating
real
time
operations
for
all
components
of
the
system
the
research
team
at
quantlab
used
many
leading
edge
modelling
methodologies
such
as
genetic
algorithms
neural
networks
principal
component
analysis
kernel
density
estimation
fast
kernel
regression
hidden
markov
modelling
and
many
other
pattern
recognition
walk
forward
back
testing
and
other
simulation
techniques
i
was
the
sole
individual
on
a
team
of
that
had
any
practical
trading
experience
and
therefore
felt
that
i
played
a
critical
role
in
the
application
and
implementation
of
each
of
the
system
components
from
data
mining
to
research
to
signal
generation
to
execution
beyond
that
i
was
uniquely
qualified
to
articulate
the
project
s
mission
to
investors
and
therefore
was
highly
successful
in
spearheading
support
financial
and
otherwise
from
our
network
althought
i
did
not
ask
specifically
i
surmise
from
your
question
that
you
are
leading
a
research
effort
i
believe
that
my
skill
set
is
best
served
as
a
liaison
between
research
and
trading
since
i
speak
both
languages
i
believe
that
i
possess
great
vision
and
enthusiasim
that
could
be
leveraged
in
a
group
project
or
product
management
role
to
integrate
and
streamline
diverse
systems
and
processes
a
common
scenario
in
most
proprietary
development
settings
today
in
closing
i
would
like
to
learn
more
about
enron
and
the
financial
technology
effort
therein
through
further
discussion
with
you
or
if
that
is
not
appropriate
someone
to
whom
you
would
be
comfortable
referring
me
i
look
forward
to
your
thoughts
best
regards
paul
