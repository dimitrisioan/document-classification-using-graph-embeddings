gentlemen
we
have
had
favorable
responses
regarding
the
use
of
our
volatility
reduction
method
roger
i
ve
attached
a
copy
of
our
article
in
case
you
hadn
t
seen
it
however
there
continued
to
be
a
quibble
about
how
to
create
the
set
of
data
points
that
would
be
inputs
into
the
testing
process
last
week
the
consulting
arm
of
a
big
five
accounting
firm
indicated
that
the
following
method
proposed
by
us
would
be
acceptable
we
believe
this
method
overcomes
the
statistical
problems
that
arise
from
using
interest
rate
differences
from
overlapping
rolling
quarters
method
calculate
daily
yield
curve
changes
expressed
as
ratios
using
historical
rates
from
the
most
recent
say
two
years
note
no
overlap
this
results
in
a
set
of
around
vectors
of
ratios
approximately
trading
days
per
year
example
if
the
first
three
yield
curves
in
the
historical
set
look
like
this
then
the
change
from
to
is
and
the
change
from
to
is
randomly
select
of
these
ratio
vectors
approx
trading
days
in
a
quarter
multiply
these
ratio
vectors
together
to
get
a
single
vector
ie
the
mo
ratios
are
multiplied
together
the
lyr
ratios
are
multiplied
togeter
etc
the
result
represents
a
single
quarterly
yield
curve
transformation
apply
it
to
today
s
yield
curve
the
resulting
yield
curve
represents
one
simulated
quarterly
change
in
interest
rates
repeat
steps
and
until
an
adequate
number
of
yield
curves
are
generated
say
proceed
with
testing
process
