var
numbers
for
the
th
hi
andreas
i
have
run
the
var
model
for
the
th
july
and
have
attached
a
zip
file
of
the
results
the
total
var
is
and
the
cu
position
is
i
have
had
trouble
getting
hold
of
you
so
i
thought
i
would
summarised
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about
also
i
thought
i
would
give
your
ears
a
rest
basically
it
is
wrt
the
second
point
in
your
mail
yesterday
we
briefly
discussed
it
earlier
the
fax
you
sent
me
to
explain
the
risk
calculation
suggested
that
you
use
a
day
period
of
adjustment
to
calculate
the
risk
in
this
case
it
is
called
capital
at
risk
the
var
calculation
for
our
model
is
for
a
one
day
holding
period
which
means
that
your
risk
factor
will
be
reduced
by
a
factor
equal
the
sqrt
or
since
old
risk
factor
std
of
the
price
movement
new
daily
risk
factor
which
actually
equates
to
std
of
approx
a
day
i
am
happy
with
this
as
a
estimate
of
the
vol
as
the
annualized
spot
vol
we
are
showing
for
cu
is
approx
which
equates
to
approx
daily
using
this
new
risk
factor
for
the
daily
var
the
cu
positions
would
give
a
var
for
the
th
of
approx
m
which
is
less
that
the
figure
we
estimated
the
other
thing
is
that
by
taking
net
numbers
we
are
disregarding
the
term
structure
of
the
price
curve
vol
curve
and
position
curve
and
are
hence
collapsing
everything
into
a
one
factor
model
which
means
that
it
is
difficult
to
compare
the
numbers
i
hope
that
this
helps
to
explain
our
number
hopefully
we
can
talk
tomorrow
cheers
