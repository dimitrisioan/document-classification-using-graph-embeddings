re
new
copier
information
for
cpm
digital
machines
iain
we
went
and
looked
at
the
toshiba
copier
on
the
nd
floor
and
while
it
does
not
appear
to
be
extremely
fast
i
believe
it
will
work
for
the
th
floor
i
spoke
with
vince
kaminski
and
he
agreed
with
our
getting
this
copier
we
noticed
this
copier
has
a
button
that
says
network
connection
and
were
wondering
it
this
copier
could
be
hooked
up
to
the
network
and
we
could
run
copies
from
our
computer
please
let
us
know
thanks
for
all
your
help
and
have
a
wonderful
christmas
and
new
year
