last

uk
traders
asked
us
to
review
the
correlations
across
uk
gas
and
power
as
well
as
the
correlations
across
efa

we
did
part
of

last

now
we
ll
update
the

re

correlation
scenarios
thanks
tanya
these
are
interesting
results
i
am
on
vacation
next
week
so
here
are
my
current
thoughts
i
am
contactable
on
my
mobile
if
necessary
gas
to
power
correlations
i
see
your
point
about
gas
to
power
correlation
only
affecting
var
for
the
combined
gas
and
power
portfolio
and
this
raises
an
interesting
point
at
a
conservative
long
term
correlation
combined
var
is
olmm
less
than
previously
expected
so
how
does
this
affect
the
limit
breach
strictly
speaking
we
are
still
over
our
uk
power
limit
but
the
limit
was
set
when
we
were
assuming
no
gas
power
correlation
and
therefore
a
higher
portfolio
var
a
suggested
way
forward
given
the
importance
of
the
spread
options
to
the
uk
gas
and
power
books
can
we
allocate
to
the
gas
and
power
books
a
share
of
the
reduction
in
portfolio
var
ie
reduction
portfolio
var
sum
power
var
gas
var
also
if
i
understand
your
mail
correctly
matrix
implies
gas
power
correlation
is
consistent
with
our
correlation
curves
and
this
reduces
total
var
by
ol
mm
efa
slot
correlations
the
issue
of
whether
our
existing
efa
to
efa
correlation
matrix
is
correct
is
a
separate
issue
i
don
t
understand
where
the
matrix
efa
to
efa
correlations
come
from
but
i
am
happy
for
you
to
run
some
historical
correlations
from
the
forward
curves
use
the
first
years
i
would
suggest
our
original
matrix
was
based
on
historicals
but
the
analysis
is
worth
doing
again
your
matrix
results
certainly
indicate
how
important
these
correlations
are
closing
thoughts
friday
s
trading
left
us
longer
so
i
would
not
expect
a
limit
breach
on
monday
we
are
still
reviewing
the
shape
of
the
long
term
curve
and
i
d
like
to
wait
until
both
simon
hastings
and
i
are
back
in
the
office
monday

before
finalising

re
var
correlation
scenarios
everybody
oliver
sent
us
the
var
number
for
different
correlations
for
uk
power
portfolio
separately
from
uk
gas
portfolio
first
if
var
is
calculated
accurately
the
correlation
between
power
and
gas
curves
should
not
affect
var
number
for
power
and
var
number
for
gas
only
the
aggregate
number
will
be
affected
the
changes
you
see
are
due
to
the
fact
that
we
use
monte
carlo
simulation
method
which
accuracy
depends
on
the
number
of
simulations
even
if
we
don
t
change
the
correlations
but
use
different
realizations
of
random
numbers
we
get
slightly
different
result
from
the
model
so
to
see
the
effect
of
using
different
correlations
between
gas
and
power
we
should
look
at
the
aggregate
number
i
calculated
weighted
correlations
based
on
curves
i
got
from
paul
as
the
weights
along
the
term
structure
i
used
the
product
of
price
position
and
volatility
for
each
time
bucket
for
gas
and
each
of
efa
slots
the
results
are
shown
below
inserting
these
numbers
into
the
original
correlation
matrix
produced
negatively
definite
correlation
matrix
which
brakes
var
engine
correlation
matrix
for
any
set
of
random
variables
is
non
negative
by
definition
and
remains
non
negatively
definite
if
calculated
properly
based
on
any
historical
data
here
according
to
our
phone
discussion
we
started
experimenting
with
correlations
assuming
the
same
correlation
for
each
efa
slot
and
et
elec
versus
gas
i
am
sending
you
the
spreadsheet
which
summaries
the
results
in
addition
to
the
aggregate
var
numbers
for
the
runs
oliver
did
you
can
see
the
var
numbers
based
on
correlation
matrix
and
matrix
in
matrix
the
correlations
across
efa
slots
are
identical
to
these
in
original
matrix
i
obtained
this
matrix
by
trial
and
error
matrix
is
produces
by
naveen
using
finger
s
algorithm
it
differs
from
original
matrix
across
efa
slots
as
well
as
in
power
versus
gas
correlations
and
gives
higher
var
than
matrix
does
concluding
we
will
look
at
the
historical
forward
prices
and
try
to
calculate
historical
correlations
from
them

interesting
to
note
that
for
a

var
increases
which
is
counter
to
intuition
this
implies
that
we
need
to
look
into
how

are

applied
within
the

once
we
can
derive
