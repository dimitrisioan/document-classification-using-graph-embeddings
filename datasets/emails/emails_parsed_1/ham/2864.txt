naphtha
hedge
for
folks
i
am
forwarding
this
in
order
for
the
team
to
focus
on
the
naphtha
issue
please
note
that
as
phase
ii
comes
on
line
blocks
b
and
c
will
first
have
to
run
on
naphtha
for
a
period
of
months
this
will
hit
us
some
time
in
hence
is
a
more
urgent
issue
than
lng
which
is
still
a
year
away
if
there
are
delays
in
the
commissioning
of
the
regas
terminal
the
period
on
naphtha
could
further
prolong
the
naphtha
market
is
more
volatile
than
the
crude
market
and
is
not
as
deep
hence
we
need
to
take
small
positions
early
on
to
test
the
market
dpc
board
has
already
approved
a
risk
management
policy
that
allows
for
hedging
we
may
need
to
look
into
options
that
are
costless
selling
put
and
buying
call
to
begin
with
and
test
while
only
block
a
is
in
place
close
coordination
will
be
required
on
this
with
the
global
markets
group
and
i
propose
someone
like
anshuman
should
actually
be
seconded
onto
the
group
a
whole
plan
on
tools
to
manage
the
fuel
risk
need
to
be
worked
in
close
coordination
with
the
team
on
the
ground
these
are
just
some
of
my
thoughts
with
of
the
tariff
being
fuel
price
dependent
this
is
an
area
that
requires
close
attention

subject
naphtha
hedge
for
current
level
of
naphtha
prices
and
the
crude
futures
curve
being
backwardated
provide
an
opportune
time
for
dpc
to
enter
into
a
hedge
for
all
or
a
portion
of
its
naphtha
requirements
for
the
year
we
efi
would
like
to
explore
this
possibility
before
this
situation
passes
please
advise
best
