jeff
a
short
follow
up
on
the
p
options
attached
is
a
chart
showing
historical
correlations
for
calendar
spreads
between
futures
contracts
it
shows
correlation
over
four
different
time
horizons
up
to
the
roll
of
the
nearest
contract
in
each
pair
as
you
can
see
the
level
is
usually
higher
than
and
often
near
if
our
current
book
of
index
p
options
were
re
marked
at
a
correlation
it
would
result
in
a
reduction
in
m
t
m
value
of
about
million
according
to
my
estimate
