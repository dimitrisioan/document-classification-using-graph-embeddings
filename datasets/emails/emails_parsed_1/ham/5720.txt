me
so
i
need
to
coordinate
with

made
some
nice
progress
that
i
d
like
to
present
and
also
integrate
eric

of

i
hope
things
are
going
well
and
you
are
not
staying
too
busy
we
should
start
planning
for
your
next
trip
to
houston
as
i
m
sure
your
schedule
will
be
getting
full
very
soon
perhaps
you
could
give
the
people
in
enron
broadband
an
overview
of
the
areas
of
interest
within
your
research
group
i
m
sure
we
could
also
benefit
from
you
views
of
how
the
current
technology
is
evolving
are
there
certain
dates
which
would
potentially
work
for
you
please
let
me
know
by
email
or
give
me
a
call
at
looking
forward
to
talking
with
you
