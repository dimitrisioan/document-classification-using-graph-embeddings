re
uk
portfolios
and
books
setup
in
risktrac
naveen
and
matthew
i
started
looking
systematically
through
uk
positions
and
corresponding
var
numbers
in
the
risckrac
i
found
a
few
inconsistencies
so
far
the
portfolio
elsb
nbp
has
a
book
elsb
under
it
the
sum
of
delta
positions
for
this
book
is
the
sum
of
gamma
positions
is
var
for
the
portfolio
elsb
nbp
is
zero
the
same
refers
to
a
few
other
portfolios
for
example
elsb
nbp
elsb
nbp
e
xxl
nbp
the
portfolio
elsbp
ppp
also
has
the
book
elsb
under
it
this
book
contains
the
positions
on
pppwdl
through
pppwd
and
pppwel
through
pppwe
the
same
refers
to
the
other
books
for
example
elsb
this
looks
messy
can
someone
in
rac
go
over
all
the
portfolios
all
the
corresponding
books
and
curves
in
risktrac
and
make
sure
they
are
set
up
properly
