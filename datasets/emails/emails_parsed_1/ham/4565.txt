re
hi
good
to
hear
from
you
things
are
going
pretty
well
hear
but
busy
with
the
end
of
the
semester
coming
up
as
for
u
of
h
i
guess
there
are
several
possibilities
depending
on
what
shane
wants
to
do
the
best
researcher
in
their
group
by
far
in
my
opinion
is
bong
soo
lee
but
he
does
more
general
asset
pricing
stuff
minnesota
econ
phd
really
smart
their
main
derivatives
guy
is
rabon
rabinovich
he
s
done
some
good
work
in
the
past
but
not
very
active
in
the
last
five
or
ten
years
or
you
could
go
with
ron
singer
or
art
warga
art
s
more
respected
and
more
active
these
guys
are
more
senior
more
general
and
do
more
research
than
ramon
i
would
guess
that
they
tend
to
be
the
workhorses
in
terms
of
advising
phd
students
at
u
of
h
in
any
case
please
destroy
this
info
as
soon
as
you
digest
it
i
would
hate
for
my
candidate
assessments
to
ever
get
passed
along
to
the
good
folks

u
of
