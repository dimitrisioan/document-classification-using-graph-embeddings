bhavna
the
basis
report
has
been
updated
to
cover
prices
it
is
called
basisnw
xls
and
is
in
the
erg
database
it
looks
to
be
working
correctly
but
of
course
without
data
it
is
a
little
hard
to
confirm
as
always
it
is
ultimately
your
job
to
verify
that
the
numbers
reported
are
correct
lem
me
know
if
there
are
problems
it
is
easy
to
change
the
spreadsheet
to
start
a
new
year
you
should
keep
this
mail
message
as
a
reference
add
to
the
expression
in
printmacro
b
i
e
change
copy
offset
henrycash
againstyear
i
to
define
a
new
cell
reference
on
the
basis
page
for
the
first
date
to
be
printed
out
on
the
report
page
for
example
last
year
the
basis
report
went
from
jan
to
dec
in
basisnw
xls
there
is
a
name
jan
defined
as
basis
a
i
e
refers
to
the
row
where
the
jan
basis
numbers
are
recorded
this
year
in
basisnw
xls
i
defined
jan
to
refer
