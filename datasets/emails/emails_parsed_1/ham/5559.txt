re
short
sell
vs
exercise
chonawee
as
i
have
pointed
out
short
selling
the
stock
may
be
a
bad
decision
because
of
tax
implications
ignoring
the
legal
aspects
suppose
the
strike
is
and
you
were
granted
an
atm
option
you
sell
short
at
ten
lots
one
lot
shares
the
price
goes
to
you
lose
x
on
your
short
position
option
exercise
gives
you
this
is
before
taxes
you
pay
taxes
on
your
option
income
it
s
treated
as
ordinary
income
the
tax
is
x
you
can
use
only
of
your
loss
against
ordinary
income
this
saves
you
only
in
taxes
of
course
if
you
have
capital
gains
you
can
use
losses
on
your
option
position
as
an
offset
the
remaining
part
of
your
capital
loss
is
carried
forward
and
you
get
the
tax
benefits
over
time
less
the
time
value
of
money
assuming
you
have
income
in
the
future
or
capital
gains
not
so
good
by
the
way
valuation
and
optimal
exercise
of
employee
stock
options
is
a
very
interesting
and
difficult
problem

subject
short
sell
vs
exercise
below
is
my
writing
that
was
originally
planned
to
post
somewhere
it
explains
how
to
handle
a
special
type
of
call
options
which
can
be
exercised
but
can
not
be
sold
as
we
know
that
it
is
never
optimal
to
exercise
a
call
option
before
its
maturity
however
after
taking
vince
s
comments
on
the
ordinary
income
capital
loss
tax
offsetting
issue
i
think
this
is
not
a
good
article
anymore
i
guess
i
could
just
throw
this
article
away
chonawee
short
selling
is
better
than
exercising
your
employee
stock
options
in
general
the
sensible
time
to
exercise
your
employee
stock
option
is
when
you
speculate
that
ene
is
going
down
or
its
growth
rate
is
extremely
low
in
fact
when
exercising
the
options
you
are
speculating
that
ene
would
never
reach
this
point
plus
interest
again
during
the
years
maturity
date
or
until
you
leave
the
company
if
you
do
not
anticipate
that
you
should
hold
on
to
your
options
because
you
can
gain
higher
profit
by
delaying
your
exercise
however
if
you
believe
that
ene
is
reaching
its
peak
then
instead
of
exercising
the
options
you
should
short
sell
or
sell
the
stocks
in
that
amount
after
short
selling
when
you
feel
that
the
stock
starts
to
go
up
you
can
buy
them
back
to
cover
make
profit
and
still
keep
the
options
on
the
other
hand
if
the
stock
does
not
go
down
as
expect
you
can
exercise
the
options
to
cover
your
short
position
anytime
let
us
take
a
look
at
a
simple
case
where
there
are
no
taxes
no
dividends
and
zero
risk
free
rate
suppose
that
ene
follows
a
simple
sample
path
as
follow
if
you
exercise
ene
options
with
a
grant
price
of
when
ene
reaches
you
would
earn
but
if
you
short
sell
ene
at
no
matter
how
much
ene
is
in
the
future
you
can
exercise
the
options
to
cover
the
short
position
and
still
earn
the
advantage
of
short
selling
comes
when
ene
at
the
period
is
at
this
point
you
can
cover
your
short
position
get
and
still
keep
your
options
or
you
can
exercise
the
options
and
gain
that
is
you
still
keep
the
flexibility
of
your
options
when
you
short
sell
in
conclusion
the
only
sensible
time
to
exercise
your
employee
stock
options
is
to
cover
your
short
position
