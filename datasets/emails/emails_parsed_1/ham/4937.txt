ryan
and
i
have
looked
at
the
research
model
and
made
some
adjustments
the
treasury
rate
at
was
research
uses
which
probably
takes
into
account
the
recent
fed
bp
cut
the
maturity
is
or
years
research
uses
years
using
these
assumptions
and
a
volatility
in
the
bloomberg
collar
function
results
in
a
ceiling
of
and
a
floor
of
after
adjusting
the
research
model
for
the
changes
above
ryan
and
i
got
a
similar
range
from
the
research
model
so
we
are
comfortable
with
these
numbers
let
me
know
if
there
are
any
questions

attached

the
updated
valuation
from
bob
lee
in
research
using
the
actual
year
historical
vol
of
which
results
in
a
call
strike
of
also
he
has
confirmed
that
the
presence
of
the
swap
has
no
impact
on
the
value
of
the
collar
let

know

you
have

costless

here
s
the
calculation
using
the
historical
volatility
the
strike
drops
slightly
the
volatility
in
the
calculation
is
the
expected
future
vol
atility
looking
at
traded
options
for
hc
and
an
expected
fall
off
in
vol
for
long
dated
options
one
could
justify
a
vol
estimate
in
the
range
for
the
collar
the
presence
of
the
swap
makes
no
difference
on
the
collar
valuation
