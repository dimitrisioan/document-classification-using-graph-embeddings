i
am
collaborating

a
data
set
of
financial
records
of
companies
and
you
want
to
rate
the
companies
based
on
this
or
some
other
information
linear
programming
and
semi
definite
programming
methods
are
used
for
this
purpose
with
these
techniques
we
are
able
to
calculate
credit
rating
of
investment
companies
aaa
bbb

similar
techniques
can
be
used
for
scoring
of
credit
card
applications
and
other
classification
problems
i
am
interested
in
applied
projects
in
energy
risk
management
and
financial
engineering
area
i
will
be
happy
to
collaborate
with
you
on
this
subject
i
am
looking
for
financial
support
for
phd
