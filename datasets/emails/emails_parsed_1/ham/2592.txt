subject
vince
and
vasant
here
is
a
brief
summary
of
my
meeting
with
chris
germany
capacity
trader
at
the
east
desk
related
to
gas
transmission
typically
pipelines
lease
capacity
billed
on
a
monthly
basis
an
example
might
be
the
pipeline
between
south
texas
and
brooklyn
where
you
might
pay
per
month
per
decatherms
of
capacity
per
day
a
fixed
payment
variable
charges
are
for
fuel
costs
shrinkage
and
for
overhead
expenses
a
gas
trader
might
call
south
texas
and
be
quoted
a
delivery
price
tomorrow
of
nymex
basis
and
might
call
brooklyn
and
be
quoted
a
delivered
price
of
nymex
the
trader
s
spread
is
and
variable
costs
of
transmission
are
so
the
trader
would
offer
the
leaseholder
of
capacity
up
to
for
firm
capacity
tomorrow
as
for
the
distinction
betweem
firm
and
interruptible
the
leaseholders
have
an
excellent
knowledge
of
the
firm
equivalent
of
interruptible
capacity
also
many
pipelines
don
t
discount
firm
capacity
from
the
tariff
maximum
it
s
not
worth
their
time
to
haggle
there
is
a
further
issue
of
secondary
markets
not
important
to
the
model
yet
for
south
texas
and
brooklyn
there
are
several
different
routes
the
gas
can
physically
take
pipelines
of
enron
texas
eastern
etc
and
once
the
trade
is
in
the
system
traders
can
cover
the
enron
positions
on
each
end
of
the
pipeline
in
so
doing
freeing
up
the
capacity
for
other
contracts
