re
greetings
from
baylor
university
jim
sorry
for
the
delay
in
responding
to
your
message
i
was
traveling
extensively
and
was
overwhelmed
with
many
different
projects
i
shall
be
glad
to
speak
at
the
gamma
iota
sigma
dinner
unfortunately
i
can
not
make
a
presentation
to
your
class
it
would
require
leaving
the
office
for
two
days
in
a
row
i
can
however
promise
to
come
on
another
day
and
speak
to
your
students
i
hope
everything
is
going
well
for
you
by
the
way
your
former
student
shane
green
has
joined
us
for
month
and
is
doing
exceptionally
well

greetings
from
baylor
university
dear
vince
since
we
last
corresponded
i
have
left
lsu
and
am
now
professor
of
finance
insurance
at
baylor
university
in
waco
tx
my
colleague
at
baylor
john
martin
mentioned
that
you
will
be
coming
to
campus
for
a
conference
on
friday
february
that
he
is
organizing
i
am
curious
whether
your
schedule
might
permit
staying
over
that
evening
so
that
we
can
feature
you
as
our
dinner
speaker
for
the
chartering
ceremony
of
gamma
iota
sigma
a
national
risk
management
fraternity
for
that
matter
would
you
also
possibly
be
available
to
make
any
presentations
to
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
on
the
previous
day
thursday
february
what
i
have
in
mind
is
a
presentation
similar
to
the
presentations
you
made
last
spring
to
my
lsu
classes
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
request
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
once
again
sincerely
