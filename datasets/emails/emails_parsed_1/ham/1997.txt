rab
multiples
i
talked
with
keith
harris
our
cfo
at
wessex
about
the
rab
multiple
graph
i
gave
you
he
expressed
that
the
wessex
people
had
originated
the
data
and
that
the
graph
was
correct
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
the
only
but
very
important
correction
is
that
they
started
the
graph
at
an
index
of
which
does
not
imply
a
of
rab
multiple
rather
the
initial
rab
multiple
was
around
implying
that
the
entire
line
should
be
taken
down
by
percentile
points
thus
the
all
time
hime
in
late
should
be
closer
to
the
x
rab
that
i
had
targeted
during
our
discussion
please
call
keith
if
he
has
not
yet
contact
you
