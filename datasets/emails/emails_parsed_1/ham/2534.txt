hi
martina
i
believe
that
the
forecasts
are
accurately
reflecting
this
please
see
graphs
below
both
models
really
need
our
rpi
curve
to
be
linked
at
the
moment
i
have
just
copied
the
number
forward
because
the
auto
regressive
error
term
is
not
very
important
we
can
run
the
models
forward
with
reasonable
confidence
as
i
mentioned
i
don
t
think
we
can
really
run
this
model
more
than
months
in
fact
i
think
we
should
run
for
months
and
blend
the
next
months
out
with
the
long
term
model
hope
i
can
fix
the
long
term
ones
now
with
some
new
insight
regards
anjam
