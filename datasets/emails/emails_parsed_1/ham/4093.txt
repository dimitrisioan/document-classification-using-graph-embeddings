nowa

poland
from
a
small

humming
among
the

near
the
ukrainian
border
enron
corp
has
staked
its
claim
on
the
polish
energy
market
yet
after
six
years
the
company
is
still
seeking
a
mother
lode
the
houston
based
energy
producer
and
trader
entered
poland
in
nabbed
one
of
the
first
power
trading
licenses
to
go
to
a
foreign
company
and
began
work
on
elektrocieplownie
nowa
sarzyna
poland
s
first
new
foreign
operated
heat
and
power
plant
other
companies
followed
including
electricite
de
france
rwe
ag
of
germany
vattenfall
ab
of
sweden
and
tractebel
sa
of
belgium
the
prize
could
be
a
rich
one
all
of
these
companies
hope
to
profit
as
poland
sells
its
state
energy
assets
and
frees
prices
before
joining
the
european
union
a
wholesale
power
bourse
is
due
to
open
in
warsaw
in
july
and
the
country
s
transmission
links
to
markets
east
and
west
could
make
poland
the
power
trading
hub
of
central
europe
but
after
six
years
in
poland
enron
has
yet
to
earn
a
profit
net
income
from
nowa
sarzyna
which
is
to
begin
commercial
production
later
this
month
is
at
least
five
years
away
power
trading
operations
might
generate
profits
next
year
if
the
new
bourse
gets
moving
but
that
is
one
big
question
mark
says
jarek
astramowicz
enron
poland
s
president
indeed
despite
its
promise
poland
s
energy
sector
remains
a
sizzling
tangle
of
aging
plants
archaic
market
agreements
and
complex
shifting
regulations
enron
with
billion
billion
euros
in
annual
revenue
is
an
innovator
and
an
investment
bellwether
for
its
peers
but
in
a
power
market
as
negatively
charged
as
poland
s
the
company
also
is
an
example
of
how
shaky
market
conditions
can
keep
even
the
savviest
competitors
offline
these
are
very
large
operations
and
to
some
extent
they
can
bear
some
risks
says
pawel
kaminski
energy
sector
operations
officer
at
the
world
bank
in
warsaw
but
eventually
they
have
to
generate
some
return
enron
pioneered
wholesale
gas
and
electricity
trading
in
the
u
s
it
entered
europe
in
setting
up
in
london
as
the
u
k
s
energy
sector
liberalized
it
entered
the
nordic
market
in
and
today
is
the
nord
pool
s
largest
volume
trader
enron
says
it
takes
about
two
years
to
find
a
site
and
obtain
permits
for
a
power
plant
and
a
further
months
for
construction
just
four
years
after
entering
the
u
k
enron
finished
its
megawatt
teesside
plant
teesside
s
capacity
and
cost
at
gbp
million
billion
euros
are
many
times
larger
than
nowa
sarzyna
s
yet
teesside
was
completed
in
only
two
thirds
the
time
the
company
declines
to
compare
development
times
in
various
countries
i
wouldn
t
necessarily
put
poland
into
the
same
category
as
russia
says
philip
davies
regulatory
and
government
affairs
manager
at
enron
europe
in
london
but
obviously
given
poland
s
planned
economy
past
it
probably
takes
a
bit
longer
to
work
through
the
regulatory
process
and
get
to
the
starting
point
at
nowa
sarzyna
it
took
enron
nearly
twice
the
usual
time
to
reach
the
starting
point
even
though
mr
astramowicz
already
knew
the
site
and
the
polish
power
industry
s
rules
the
nowa
sarzyna
plant
was
mr
astramowicz
s
brainchild
and
he
burned
out
the
engine
in
his
first
bmw
as
he
traveled
between
warsaw
and
the
town
to
craft
the
deal
a
freelance
energy
sector
entrepreneur
before
joining
enron
mr
astramowicz
sold
his
interest
in
nowa
sarzyna
to
enron
in
enron
has
spent
million
to
build
nowa
sarzyna
a
megawatt
gas
fired
combined
heat
and
power
plant
quiet
clean
and
efficient
the
plant
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
most
of
poland
s
belching
coal
fired
behemoths
when
it
starts
up
this
month
it
will
sell
its
electricity
to
the
polish
power
grid
the
country
s
high
voltage
network
under
a
year
power
purchase
agreement
or
ppa
that
enron
won
in
steam
output
goes
to
organika
the
chemical
company
next
door
and
helps
heat
the
town
of
nowa
sarzyna
the
nowa
sarzyna
plant
is
more
than
financed
by
commercial
bank
loans
for
which
the
only
collateral
is
the
plant
s
concluded
contracts
they
were
betting
on
their
good
name
says
michael
davies
a
partner
with
allen
overy
the
warsaw
law
firm
that
advised
enron
poland
s
lenders
they
are
pushing
envelopes
all
the
time
that
is
especially
true
in
a
market
with
overcapacity
where
an
energy
law
didn
t
even
exist
until
says
peter
bisztyga
emerging
europe
utilities
analyst
at
solomon
smith
barney
in
london
because
enron
signed
a
ppa
they
are
ok
but
i
m
really
not
sure
building
nowa
sarzyna
was
such
a
good
idea
mr
bisztyga
says
enron
could
have
generated
a
faster
return
by
renovating
an
existing
power
plant
but
he
acknowledges
nowa
sarzyna
allowed
enron
to
get
into
the
polish
market
early
and
stamp
their
name
on
it
in
polish
power
plants
weren
t
for
sale
energy
asset
privatization
discussed
for
years
began
in
earnest
only
this
year
by
the
polish
government
proposes
to
sell
off
stakes
in
dozens
of
power
plants
distribution
companies
and
the
polish
power
grid
a
kilometer
national
transmission
network
of
high
voltage
lines
the
assets
have
a
total
book
value
of
billion
zlotys
billion
euros
but
murky
regulations
have
driven
prices
down
the
regulations
don
t
promote
competition
and
so
you
don
t
really
know
the
price
of
electricity
says
bengt
wegemo
president
of
vattenfall
poland
earlier
this
year
vattenfall
paid
million
for
in
warsaw
based
elektrocieplownie
warszawskie
promising
million
in
investment
in
the
heat
and
power
plant
over
the
next
years
investors
hope
the
new
power
market
will
bring
clarity
over
pricing
ultimately
licensed
energy
traders
and
large
power
users
will
trade
on
the
bourse
setting
the
wholesale
price
of
electricity
the
polish
bourse
will
be
modeled
on
its
nordic
counterpart
enron
the
nord
pool
s
largest
trader
hopes
to
post
polish
trading
profits
by
but
first
say
market
experts
poland
s
energy
law
must
be
amended
to
ease
functioning
of
the
bourse
and
free
up
access
to
poland
s
distribution
network
further
the
government
says
it
must
solve
the
competition
problem
posed
by
the
polish
power
grid
s
power
purchase
agreements
which
account
for
of
energy
sales
in
poland
some
state
owned
plants
used
the
agreements
as
collateral
to
secure
modernization
financing
when
prices
are
freed
these
plants
might
go
bankrupt
if
forced
to
compete
with
plants
that
didn
t
spend
money
to
modernize
the
government
is
contemplating
a
special
fund
to
compensate
the
modernized
plants
for
their
extra
costs
though
nowa
sarzyna
is
a
private
plant
the
price
enron
must
charge
for
its
power
is
about
twice
what
outmoded
plants
charge
we
are
hoping
that
continuous
efficient
operation
of
the
plant
will
generate
us
a
bigger
profit
mr
astramowicz
says
another
problem
is
cross
border
power
trading
where
contradictory
legislation
essentially
gives
a
monopoly
to
the
polish
power
grid
also
known
as
pse
enron
and
others
protest
that
pse
shouldn
t
compete
with
electricity
market
participants
who
contract
with
it
for
transmission
service
pse
intends
to
stay
in
the
trading
business
says
marek
zerka
pse
s
vice
president
in
late
march
pse
and
local
company
kulczyk
holding
signed
an
agreement
with
preussenelektra
ag
of
germany
to
export
electricity
and
coal
to
eu
countries
via
germany
this
is
great
news
mr
astramowicz
says
if
this
joint
venture
gets
access
to
pse
s
cross
border
transmission
capacity
i
would
expect
pse
to
confirm
open
access
to
all
market
participants
enron
and
others
are
pushing
hard
for
that
access
as
soon
as
the
market
becomes
open
free
and
non
discriminatory
we
will
come
out
at
a
decent
profit
