my
latest
effort

i
would
appreciate
your
thoughts
i
know
that
we
haven
t
written
together
before
so
let
me
assure
me
that
you
will
not
hurt
my
feelings
by
slashing
away
with
a
red
pen
i
think
that
i
have
put
all
the
clay
on
the
table
for
this
piece
of
sculpture
but
it
is
still
pretty
crude
help
me
refine
the
work
to
create
something
we
can
both
be
very
proud
of
by
the
way
i
know
you
are
extremely
busy
right
now
so
don
t
feel
pressured
to
spend
lots
of
time
here
any
guidance
you
can
offer
will
be
appreciated

t
