moyez
thanks
i
will
try
and
collect
the
information
today
vasant
and
i
were
thinking
that
it
would
make
sense
to
let
people
try
the
application
under
the
test
environment
for
a
few
weeks
then
we
can
incorporate
any
additional
suggestions
and
move
to
production
around
the
first
week
in
april
our
meeting
room
does
have
a
screen
and
network
connection
and
we
can
profide
an
lcd
projector
as
well
how
about
thursday
of
next
week

migrate
to

as
far
as
the
demo
is
concerned


ll
be
happy
to
accommodate
your
group

liveline
test

moyez
can
you
add
access
to
the
following
users
for
the
livelink
research
projects
database
also
would
you
be
available
to
give
a
short
demonstration
and
tutorial
on
how
to
use
livelink
for
our
group
we
hold
a
lunch
meeting
each
thursday
from
in
cl
at
which
there
is
usually
a
short
presentation
on
a
topic
of
interest
i
think
it
would
be
very
useful
for
the
group
to
have
an
overview
of
how
to
use
the
tool
before
everyone
jumps
into
it
the
presentation
can
be
quite
informal
let
me
know
if
you
would
be
available
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks
