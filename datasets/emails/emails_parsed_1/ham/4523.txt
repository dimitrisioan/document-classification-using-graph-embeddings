i
shared
confidentially
with
vince
kaminski
my
developing
concept
of
a
highly
inefficient
not
for
profit
enterprise
with
dramatically
increasing
costs
i
believe
that
a
for
profit
economic
model
is
possible
that
should
reverse
these
skyrocketing
costs
and
ultimately
lower
the
commodity
thereby
having
a
national
if
not
global
impact
of
health
care
costs
vince
seems
to
also
believe
in
the
concepts
potential
the
ceo
of
one
of
the
biggest
u
s
blood
banks
has
already
asked
to
become
involved
i
would
like
involve
more
people
with
vision
means
and
desire
to
help
make
this
a
reality
i
would
look
forward
to
meeting
with
you
to
talk
further
