i
have
recently
come
on
board
as
treasurer
enron
india
prior
to
joining
i
was
with
reliance
industries
a
petrochemical
conglomerate
in
india
the
central
banking
authorities
are
now
thinking
of
permitting
corporates
to
hedge
their
oil
and
other
related
risks
i
believe
the
literature
published
by
risk
in
collaboration
with
enron
has
come
to
be
considered
as
an
industry
standard
would
it
be
possible
to
arrange
for
two
copies
to
be
sent
across
to
us
