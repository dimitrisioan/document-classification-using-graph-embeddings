i
think
we
need
to
sit
down
and
talk
about
developing
reporting
that
will
show
the
risk
in
the
books
at
this
point
and
time
it
can
be
derived
but
only
if
you
know
what
to
look
for
i
would
appreciate
if
you
had
some
time
to
do
so

looking
at
these
numbers
i
think
the
var
model
must
be
waaaaaaaaaay
over
calcing
something
most
likely
the
spreads
the
net
and
outright
product
position
are
negligible
seems
it
would
take
one
hell
of
a
daily
move
to
loose
on
these
positions
