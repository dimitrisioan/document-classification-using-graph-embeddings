mr

i
am
glad
we
were
able
to
reach
a
practical
solution
for
you
without
going
too
much
against
the
grain
of
enron
corp
s
it
policy
and
standards
thanks
to
david
wile
and
mark
hall
in
formulating
a
solution
that
addresses
everyone
s
needs
in
summary
your
contingency
and
recovery
machine
laptop
will
be
imaged
for
win
applications
will
be
evaluated
for
compatibility
this
will
allow
you
to
use
the
machine
as
a
back
up
to
gather
weather
data
off
the
internet
via
independent
dial
out
line
in
case
the
normal
enron
network
architecture
is
unavailable
i
will
follow
up
to
make
sure
we
capture
the
one
exception
to
the
policy
and
standard
that
surfaced
local
admin
rights
on
the
laptop
for
development
activity
