thanks
for
your
excellent
suggestion
of
using
a
retention
bonus
for
martin
lin
in
order
to
address
both
the
issues
of
compensation
and
retention
for
him
as
i
mentioned
during
our
meeting
just
my
small
team
within
research
has
lost
people
over
about
the
last
years
and
we
have
had
a
hard
time
recruiting
good
candidates
last
year
we
made
an
offer
to
a
person
graduating
from
ut
ms
in
computational
finance
of
k
plus
k
signing
bonus
he
replied
that
he
would
like
to
work
at
enron
but
was
already
in
the
position
of
turning
down
an
offer
with
a
base
salary
above
k
martin
is
a
very
skilled
individual
with
a
ph
d
in
electrical
engineering
and
almost
two
years
experience
at
enron
he
would
be
very
difficult
and
expensive
to
replace
for
this
reason
i
feel
it
necessary
to
be
proactive
in
finding
ways
of
retaining
him
as
an
employee
please
let
me
know
if
we
have
a
green
light
to
go
forward
with
a
year
retention
bonus
of
k
and
a
raise
to
k
base
salary
for
mr
lin
i
would
plan
to
then
give
martin
an
additional
raise
at
his
next
review
period
