in
order
to
release
these

research
has
to
have
each
version
under
clearcase
then
we
will
run
vatrfacs
code
in
stage
environment
stage
has
been
refreshed
recently
run
var
code
in
stage
and
validate
the
results
it
is
time
to
start
releasing
these
versions
projects
and
require
some
experimental
runs
in

a

traders
in
gas

and
liquids
markets

as

and
waiting

hope
we
can
follow
