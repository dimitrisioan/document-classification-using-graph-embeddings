subject
interview
with
enron
dear
mr
kaminski
even
though
i
can
not
pass
official
interviews
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
enron
i
was
really
impressed
by
your
presentation
and
i
think
i
would
be
a
good
fit
for
your
firm
i
know
that
you
will
be
soon
recruiting
on
campus
maybe
we
could
set
up
an
informal
meeting
either
give
me
a
call
at
home
or
send
me
an
email
at
this
address
i
would
appreciate
though
not
to
appear
on
interview
lists
