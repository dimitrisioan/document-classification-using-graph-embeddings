amy
steve
kean
and
i
finally
got
to
discuss
this
the
other
day
and
we
decided
that
this
effort
would
likely
be
too
time
consuming
and
costly
particularly
for
certain
key
employees
to
justify
doing
it
it
obviously
is
an
interesting
topic
but
one
that
would
require
alot
of
attention
and
possibly
money
to
participate
in
fully
thanks
