hi
vince
i
was
waiting
for
a
comment
about
the
email
below
before
sending
it
to
the
full
mailing
list
basically
it
suggests
that
the
copper
option
position
may
well
have
increased
the
var
by
more
than
however
given
that
the
portfoilo
has
also
changed
from
the
lst
of
august
it
is
difficult
to
asses
the
actual
change
due
to
the
option
only

hi
all
the
cu
option
position
has
entered
the
mg
books
for
the
nd
aug
the
delta
is
mt
for
dec
the
cu
var
has
gone
up
from
to
i
estimated
that
the
portfolio
for
the
lst
would
increase
to
approx
so
this
seems
sensible
the
overall
var
change
is
from
to
again
the
estimate
for
the
lst
aug
was
for
an
increase
in
var
to
all
estimates
were
based
on
a
delta
of
dmt
there
has
also
been
some
increase
in
the
var
for
aluminium
which
will
effect
the
overall
total
a
summary
is
as
follows
