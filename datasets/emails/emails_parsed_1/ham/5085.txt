sure
tomorrow
is
fine
with
me
is
it
possible
to
schedule
it
at
pm
and
i
am
sure
it
is
not
an
easy
task
to
fit
the
schedule
of
several
people
to
be
available
at
the

so
please
feel

you

please
do
not
think
we
are
always
this
unorganized
but
things
just
seem
to
be
happening
right
now
and
it
is
disrupting
everyone
s
schedule
would
you
possibly
be
able
to
come
tomorrow
the
th
kevin
kindall
will
not
be
here
on
the
th
and
he
would
definately
like
to
interview
you
then
vince
kaminski
will
be
gone
for
two
weeks
after
the
th
it
seems
like
tomorrow
might
be
the
best
time
for
everyone
if
it
is
for
you
we
can
begin
the
interviews
at
pm
and
probably
end
them
at
or
pm
please
let
me
know
thanks
so

definitely
any
of
these
days
sound
good
to
me
the
only
concern
that
i
have
is
that
i
have
my
graduate
class
on
thursday
night
at
pm
which
is
september
the
th
so
if
you
will
schedule
the
interview
on
the
th
of
september
i
would
need
to
leave
around
pm
so
i
could
attend
my
class
it
actually
might
be
more
convenient
for
me
to
meet
with
the
interviewers
on
the
th
of
september
if
this
day
does
not
fit
the
schedule
of
any
of
the
interested
in
interviewing
individuals
i
surely
will
be
able
to
meet
with
them
on
the
th
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
your
reply
