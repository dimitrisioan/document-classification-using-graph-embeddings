re
estimating
tail
of
distribution
and
additional
risk
measures
naveen
the
analytical
var
approach
is
working
for
equity
portfolio
it
gives
us
the
tool
to
examine
the
tails
behavior
for
this
portfolio
and
calculate
expected
tail
loss
the
same
should
be
done
for
commodities
portfolio
as
well
meanwhile
as
we
discussed
we
can
give
some
rough
estimates
of
the
losses
corresponding
to
percentiles
other
than
th
look
at
the
figure
below
you
can
see
var
numbers
for
and
calculated
with
simulations
thousand
simulations
analytical
var
gamma
delta
positions
representation
and
are
very
close
because
there
are
not
many
options
in
equity
portfolio
simulations
simulations
to
calculate
var
then
in
order
to
approximately
estimate
var
for
and
i
scaled
var
with
factors
corresponding
to
normal
distribution
for
example
norminv
norminv
for
the
result
of
such
extrapolation
in
this
case
is
quite
good
just
different
from
the
correct
number
we
probably
can
use
such
rough
estimates
of
tail
for
commodities
portfolio
until
we
have
proper
methods
implemented

analytical

implementation
in

debbie
i
am
forwarding
to
you
a
page
document
describing
implementation
of
analytical
var
in
risktrac
here
is
why
this
effort
is
very
important
we
need
to
calculate
var
for
other
percentile
but
or
even
as
mentioned
by
rick
buy
and
our
simulation
model
can
not
handle
required
number
of
simulations
we
need
to
present
additional
risk
measures
such
as
mean
tail
loss
to
the
board
the
analytical
approach
is
implemented
in
a
spreadsheet
and
fully
tested
already
so
there
will
be
no
problems
with
the
algorithm
itself
we
need
to
get
together
and
discuss
it
implementation
what
do
you
think
