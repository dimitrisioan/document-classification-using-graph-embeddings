happy
new
year
and
some
new
year
s
resolutions
with
the
new
year
we
would
like
to
institute
some
rules
within
the
research
group
this
applies
to
everybody
in
research
and
is
at
the
express
request
of
vince
but
i
am
just
sending
it
to
my
reports
and
their
reports
as
of
now
people
are
expected
to
report
to
work
in
the
morning
around
am
to
am
but
no
later
than
am
this
is
primarily
because
our
clients
from
other
groups
typically
start
calling
around
am
and
we
need
to
be
responsive
of
course
once
in
a
while
if
something
urgent
comes
up
then
this
may
be
relaxed
but
you
are
responsible
for
letting
both
your
supervisor
and
your
assistant
anita
and
or
shirley
know
in
advance
i
am
trying
to
come
up
with
a
schedule
that
will
allow
me
to
get
updated
on
all
the
work
that
you
guys
are
doing
and
i
will
probably
set
this
up
next
week
after
vince
finishes
drawing
up
the
overall
directions
for
the
group
for
thanks
