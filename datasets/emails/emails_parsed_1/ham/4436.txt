dear
lance
the
university
is
predicting
a
shortfall
due
to
increased
gas
costs
of
between
and
million
over
the
next
to
years
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
wanting
to
explore
opportunities
for
the
campus
to
sell
energy
to
austin
energy
when
its
load
is
below
peak
this
big
shortfall
provides
an
impetus
for
the
university
to
want
to
maximize
the
value
of
its
plant
