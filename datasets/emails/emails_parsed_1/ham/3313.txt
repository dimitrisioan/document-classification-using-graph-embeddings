i
may
have
already
said
this
but
we
ve
had
so
many
e
mails
and
telephone
calls
flying
back
and
forth
that
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
at
least
got
this
much
out
to
you
clearly
i
would
like
you
to
set
up
the
meeting
with
the
riskcalc
gurus
to
dig
deeper
into
their
methodology
as
much
as
they
ll
tell
and
the
impact
of
missing
variables
and
any
other
idiosyncracies
the
model
may
have
also
try
to
get
a
better
feel
for
how
well
they
think
the
model
extends
to
other
countries
i
know
from
a
previous
conversation
with
lea
carty
and
reading
about
the
model
that
it
was
calibrated
off
north
american
names
but
they
suspect
it
might
extend
to
other
countries
conversely
i
know
they
are
working
efforts
within
moody
s
risk
management
services
to
develop
private
and
probably
public
firm
models
specific
to
regions
one
they
mentioned
was
australia
and
also
within
western
europe
data
as
always
was
the
issue
see
if
the
quants
have
any
perspective
on
their
success
plan
in
that
area
lastly
we
truly
appreciate
the
aggressive
efforts
you
both
have
made
toward
pushing
off
this
private
model
initiative
and
i
m
very
confident
we
ll
be
able
to
nail
a
firm
plan
down
upon
receipt
of
either
d
b
and
or
experian
data

hi
two
riskcalc
sales
people
made
a
presentation
this
week
about
their
product
they
stated
that
they
could
set
up
a
meeting
with
their
quants
and
our
people
to
discuss
the
model
input
and
what
happens
if
we
have
less
than
inputs

ooops
part
ii
i
just
threw
out
as
a
number
for
something
we
might
develop
it
s
really
not
based
on
anything
we
know
will
work
for
pre
packaged
programs
we
also
know
there
will
be
a
great
number
of
names
with
less
than
the
full
i
assume
we
would
pursue
another
model
internal
or
external
to
provide
probably
less
accurate
numbers
but
at
least
available
for
names
with
fewer
inputs

thanks
after
our
meeting
we
stuck
around
to
discuss
things
a
little
further
specifically
with
respect
to
global
counterparty
names
we
have
duns
cross
references
on
about
of
active
names
k
out
of
k
we
could
greatly
accellerate
purchase
of
some
useful
data
by
buying
blind
all
major
data
associated
with
these
specific
duns
numbers
pro
data
gets
in
on
names
we
know
we
want
to
review
asap
but
without
resolution
on
which
specific
fields
are
most
useful
we
also
get
to
test
for
completeness
of
data
how
many
have
all
fields
how
many
have
only
of
which
fields
etc
con
costs
could
be
significantly
higher
buying
info
we
don
t
know
we
need
converse
of
buying
only
the
fields
doesn
t
seem
best
answer
we
would
end
up
buying
additional
info
later
overhead
costs
and
piecemeal
buying
will
increase
costs
it
development
time
would
be
greatly
increased
multiple
file
formats
developing
to
unknown
maximum
size
etc
redoing
when
more
data
is
purchased
any
thoughts
