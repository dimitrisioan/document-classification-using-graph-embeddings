jim
i
am
attaching
below
a
small
draft
note
prepared
by
anshuman
on
lng
hedging
it
talks
of
two
products
volumetric
options
where
we
buy
a
call
on
of
the
volumes
and
sell
a
put
on
of
the
volumes
to
finance
the
call
and
ratio
derivative
where
we
buy
two
calls
at
a
higher
price
and
sell
one
at
a
lower
price
to
finance
it
this
is
not
one
that
the
traders
agree
to
since
at
the
upper
price
the
calls
bought
are
just
at
the
money
while
the
sold
call
is
in
the
money
and
will
cost
the
seller
hence
only
option
is
useful
it
could
provide
risk
mitigation
in
the
high
price
scenario
while
allowing
some
participation
in
low
prices
to
test
it
we
used
march
period
to
have
it
cost
neutral
we
would
buy
a
call
at
and
sell
the
put
at
as
we
bounce
these
ideas
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
we
work
closely
with
the
global
markets
group
the
team
on
the
ground
knows
the
contracts
better
and
maybe
able
to
give
you
insights
on
what
can
be
sold
to
mseb
would
love
to
discuss
the
same
with
you

sandeep
