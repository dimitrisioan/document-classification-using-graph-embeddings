delighted
to
say
that
the

our
logistics
team
will
be
mailing
them
out
along
with
the
speaker
guideline
packs
including
information
on
hotel
discounts
etc
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks

also
no

receive

main
mailing
campaign

the
interim

find
attached
a
shortened
pdf
copy
of
the
conference
brochure
for
your

i
did
not
want
to
send
you
the
complete
pages
as
it
would
clog
up
your
email

full
colour
version
can
be
found
on

i
hope
you
agree
that
the
speaker
plenum
and
line
up
of
topics
is
possibly
one
of
the
best
ever
and
not
surprisingly
the
event
is
already
drawing
strong
international
interest
in
particular
the
executive
summit
day
on
e
business
and
power
trading
is
taking
numerous
bookings
i
would
be
happy
for
you
to
attend
either
the
summit
day
or
one
of
our
two
intensive
post
conference
workshops
but
in
order
to
avoid
overcrowding
on
the
day
ask
that
all
reservations
be
made
in
advance
i
am
certain
that
you
have
friends
or
colleagues
who
would
be
interested
in
attending
the
conference
this
year
and
would
like
to
ask
that
you
email
the
enclosed
details
to
them
to
make
things
easy
i
have
attached
a
booking
form
which
should
be
faxed

registrations
received
through
speaker
recommendations
