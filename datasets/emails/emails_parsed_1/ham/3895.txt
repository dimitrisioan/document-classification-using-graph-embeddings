volatility
curve
generator
for
uk
power
we
have
established
a
set
of
power
volatility
curves
down
to
the
efa
monthly
level
of
detail
that
can
be
marked
to
market
up
to
years
out
beyond
this
the
volatility
decays
to
what
we
understand
to
be
the
long
term
level
for
power
volatility
given
our
understanding
of
the
behaviour
of
forward
prices
over
large
time
scales
the
swaption
traders
can
now
fit
the
first
years
of
the
volatility
curve
to
the
market
observed
baseload
swaption
implied
volatilities
typically
to
months
duration
for
the
underlying
swap
and
then
be
in
a
good
position
to
price
other
swaptions
including
swaptions
on
individual
efa
slots
consistent
with
the
curve
there
may
also
be
an
impact
on
the
daily
var
calculation
an
illustration
of
the
current
volatility
curves
is
pasted
below
these
curves
will
be
reset
as
the
market
moves
and
allow
a
mark
to
market
approach
to
be
followed
for
our
volatility
book
the

is
