lng
meeting
vince
before
i
contact
the
london
staff
about
next
wednesday
s
meeting
i
was
wondering
if
we
could
move
it
up
a
little
bit
the
reason
is
that
by
pm
in
houston
it
is
pm
in
london
and
i
thought
it
might
be
difficult
to
round
up
the
crew
in
london
at
that
time
please
let
me
know
if
we
have
plans
to
change
the
time
thanks
eric
