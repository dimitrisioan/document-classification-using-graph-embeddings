california
power
legislation
passes
short
term
measures
very
long
term
measures
as
we
said
yesterday
sb
x
passed
the
california
state
senate
easily
the
bill
gives
the
state
the
immediate
authority
to
purchase
power
via
the
department
of
water
and
resources
until
february
nd
the
department
will
have
million
available
to
finance
power
purchases
but
there
expectations
that
these
costs
could
easily
rise
to
billion
by
next
week
ab
x
has
evolved
into
a
longer
term
solution
and
in
its
current
form
would
authorize
the
department
of
water
and
resources
to
enter
into
long
term
contracts
as
opposed
to
the
day
contracts
in
sb
x
to
buy
power
at
a
price
cap
of
cents
per
kw
h
this
legislation
is
not
expected
to
pass
today
and
will
likely
be
changed
considerably
during
the
upcoming
two
week
period
covered
by
sb
x
when
negotiations
between
generators
the
utilities
and
the
state
are
likely
to
resume
a
second
piece
of
legislation
under
sb
x
has
created
uncertainty
in
the
markets
this
legislation
will
create
a
california
public
power
authority
with
bond
issuance
authority
the
uncertainty
concerns
whether
the
new
authority
will
address
the
problem
of
the
billion
in
outstanding
debt
owed
by
the
utilities
the
current
text
of
the
legislation
focuses
only
on
longer
term
measures
such
as
expanding
generation
capacity
and
improving
efficiency
yet
the
legislation
also
says
the
authority
may
issue
bonds
exercise
power
of
eminent
domain
and
enter
into
joint
power
agreements
and
buy
own
and
sell
land
and
facilities
necessary
for
the
financing
of
a
project
the
general
nature
of
this
language
leaves
open
the
possibility
of
either
issuing
bonds
to
finance
past
debts
or
using
eminent
domain
or
the
bond
authority
to
finance
the
utilities
as
they
enter
into
a
ch
proceeding
default
update
bush
as
we
reported
on
wednesday
the
bush
administration
continues
to
demonstrate
little
interest
in
getting
involved
