zero
curve
generator
for
uk
gilts
anjam
here
is
the
model
for
fitting
the
term
structure
of
uk
gilts
the
basic
idea
is
as
follows
dirty
price
ith
gilt
sum
j
c
i
discount
factor
t
j
i
discount
factor
t
ni
i
using
a
five
parameters
analytical
form
for
the
discount
factors
and
minimizing
the
sum
of
absolute
errors
i
can
derive
a
smooth
zero
curve
the
model
needs
an
initial
guess
for
the
parameters
this
may
require
some
experience
the
log
file
can
help
you
to
see
how
well
the
optimization
works
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
