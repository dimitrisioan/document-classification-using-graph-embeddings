a
friend
of
mine
vince
last
week
i
was
contacted
by
one
of
my
friends
who
is
very
interested
in
becoming
an
enron
employee
he
has
a
phd
and
several
years
research
and
lab
experience
richard
is
afraid
that
being
a
phd
is
a
dying
breed
and
may
need
to
go
back
to
school
to
obtain
an
mba
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
mind
looking
at
the
attached
resume
to
assess
if
you
have
any
interest
in
richard
or
if
you
feel
i
should
encourage
him
to
go
back
to
school
i
am
unclear
as
to
the
qualifications
for
your
group
so
i
apologize
if
this
request
is
way
off
base
thank
you
for
your
help
