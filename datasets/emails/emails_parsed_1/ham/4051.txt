the

noted
the

longstanding

evolving
role
in

no
state

private
counterparts
it
proposed
about
billion
in
discretionary
spending
for

william

has
asserted
speaking
at

national
governors
association
policy
forum
in

commissioner
massey
urged
officials
to
pay
attention
to
the
key
elements
of
a
national
energy
strategy
first
he
specified
there
is
a
need
for
an
adequate
supply
of
the
energy
commodity
turning
to
a
second
element
commissioner
massey
told
forum
attendees
that
all
the
supply
in

won

t
help
unless
it
can
be
delivered
over
an
adequate
efficient
non

network
commissioner
massey
identified
market
structure
as
the
third
essential
element
of
a
national
energy
strategy
while
citing
an
inherent
difficulty
that
good
structure
can
not
be
easily
parsed
between
wholesale
and
retail
jurisdictions
accordingly
he
said
ferc
and
the
states
must
work
together
on
market
structure
the
final
element
of
a
successful
energy
strategy
the
commissioner
specified
is
the
need
for
aggressive
ferc
intervention
when
markets
fail
to
do
their
job
if
the
states
can
not
depend
on
the
wholesale
market
regulator
to
ensure
reasonable
prices
for
consumers
he
cautioned
they
will
surely
think
twice
before
heading
down

path
