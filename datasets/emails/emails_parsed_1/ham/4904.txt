an
update
on
the
implementation
for
ffvols
in
comparing
days
of
historical
var
calculations
with
that
of
the
implied
for
agg
gas
we
have
found
that
the
historical
var
calculations
are
consistently
lower
over
this
period
by
roughly
mm
the
implied
volatilities
are
much
higher
at
this
period
anticipating
strong
winter
prices
at
this
time
the
consensus
is
not
to
relase
the
historical
implementation
into
production
and
the
official
line
to
traders
will
be
that
the
method
is
still
in
testing
the
historical
var
is
mm
and
the
implied
is
mm
for
effective
date
of
further
testing
is
in
progress
on
a
hybrid
methodology
which
i
mentioned
last
week
whereby
historical
vols
are
scaled
by
the
ratio
of
prompt
to
historical
prompt
volatilities
to
atleast
capture
some
implied
forward
effects
tanya
s
analysis
on
a
fictitious
portfolio
indicates
higher
var
numbers
but
poorer
backtesting
in
comparison
to
the
historical
approach
this
approach
serves
as
an
intermediate
and
seems
appropriate
in
periods
such
as
the
current
one
wherein
the
historical
numbers
might
be
considerably
lower
than
those
of
the
implied
winston
will
start
testing
using
these
hybrid
vols
and
if
the
results
are
deemed
satisfactory
that
will
be
the
production
methodology
of
course
we
will
obtain
all
var
numbers
concurrently
to
serve
as
different
indicators
and
beacons
of
risk
the
production
number
will
hopefully
be
a
sensible
compromise
of
the
different
methods
