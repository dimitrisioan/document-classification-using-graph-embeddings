george
here
s
the
story
research
forwarded
to
their
personnel
a
solicitation
they
received
for
java
training
by
an
outside
person
weeklong
classes
for
true
beginners
and
for
those
with
decent
programming
experience
in
other
languages
esp
c
vince
had
pre
agreed
tlo
pay
for
it
for
anyone
who
wanted
it
but
the
response
they
got
was
so
overwhelming
they
reconsidered
for
financial
reasons
and
decided
it
would
be
better
to
just
hire
a
professor
to
teach
a
class
for
a
week
here
the
costs
would
be
around
and
there
should
be
room
for
around
people
in
the
class
they
have
people
and
wonder
if
we
might
have
some
people
who
would
want
to
do
it
a
no
brainer
java
is
a
big
time
resume
pad
these
days
and
would
be
willing
to
share
the
costs
with
them
what
is
your
opinion
on
this
personally
i
think
it
s
a
relatively
inexpensive
investment
in
our
people
although
selfishly
it
does
increase
their
market
value
so
to
speak
of
course
nothing
keeps
directors
from
going
to
the
class
as
well
