ethylene
margin
collar
model
dear
all
let
us
meet
early
this
afternoon
here
is
the
overview
of
the
model
the
ethylene
margin
collars
are
priced
using
asian
spread
option
the
forward
curve
and
volatility
curve
are
provided
by
the
desk
the
correlation
between
the
ethylene
and
ethylene
cost
starts
from
the
historical
spot
correlation
and
grows
with
the
maturity
the
overall
mm
payout
cap
is
modeled
sepereately
i
fitted
the
historical
spread
years
data
to
a
mean
reverting
model
with
stronger
mean
reverting
strength
on
the
floor
side
the
model
produces
trajectories
that
are
statistically
simular
to
the
historical
data
then
the
expected
payoff
is
computed
through
simulation
at
the
meeting
we
will
discuss
the
assumptions
and
present
the
results
