bryan
i
talked
to
vasant
about
the
model
review
in
london
he
thought
that
he
could
accomplish
this
from
houston
but
i
think
direct
communication
makes
things
much
easier
i
think
his
trip
to
london
makes
a
lot
of
sense
kmv
confirmed
the
meeting
on
the
th
we
hope
to
get
more
information
about
the
scope
of
their
model
and
assess
its
the
applicability
to
your
business
vasant
after
a
few
days
of
immersion
in
your
operations
will
be
able
to
assess
better
the
usefulness
of
the
model

it
is
highly
unlikely
that
i
can
make
the
trip
but
i
spoke
with
vasant
today
and
he
will
try
to
get
to
london
beforehand
and
will
have
good
idea
of
our
needs
hopefully
this
will
not
cause
too
many
problems
