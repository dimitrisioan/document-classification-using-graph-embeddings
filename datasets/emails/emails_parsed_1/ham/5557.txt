generation

model
michelle
i
agree
with
you
that
we
need
to
run
at
least
iterations
but
i
did
not
realize
that
it
took
hours
to
run
iterations
helen
and
i
talked
earlier
about
using
parallel
computing
technique
to
split
the
algorithm
into
smaller
parts
and
run
the
parts
separately
on
different
processors
then
aggregate
the
results
this
procedure
makes
better
use
of
computer
power
and
saves
time
looks
like
we
have
to
do
it
this
way
now
buying
a
more
powerful
computer
helps
but
does
not
solve
the
problem
in
addition
we
might
want
to
re
consider
if
writing
the
code
in
vb
is
optimal
i
was
assured
at
the
very
beginning
that
vb
runs
as
fast
if
not
faster
as
c
but
some
re
assurance
from
it
group
on
this
issue
is
helpful

subject
generation
earnings
model
hi
alex
danielle
and
i
were
talking
to
david
m
today
regarding
running
the
model
for
purposes
of
back
testing
the
results
last
week
we
ran
calpine
using
days
of
historical
forward
price
data
at
and
iterations
the
iteration
run
took
hours
to
run
to
run
all
companies
with
the
days
worth
of
data
and
at
iterations
is
estimated
to
take
about
days
we
are
concerned
that
iterations
will
not
be
sufficient
and
will
need
to
be
increased
to
at
least
iterations
we
are
thinking
that
we
need
to
use
a
server
or
something
much
more
powerful
than
the
test
computer
we
have
been
using
do
you
have
any
suggestions
as
to
how
we
can
improve
the
process
thanks
