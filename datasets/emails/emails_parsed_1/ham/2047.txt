re
valuation
steve
please
let
me
know
when
you
come
back
i
have
detected
a
tendency
to
implement
different
approaches
to
valuation
in
the
past
to
some
extent
it
reflects
the
absence
of
formal
rules
for
sign
off
on
the
valuation
techniques
which
in
turn
reflects
the
turf
wars
and
the
desire
by
the
originators
to
control
the
outcomes

i
d
like
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
you
about
valuation
i
m
hearing
confusing
messages
about
the
way
that
the
uk
it
team
and
the
uk
traders
get
their
valuation
code
aparently
signed
off
by
research
while
here
you
provide
it
for
our
guys
to
wrap
up
we
have
now
a
situation
where
the
uk
team
are
using
a
home
grown
valuation
piece
called
dove
where
results
differ
from
those
of
the
equivalent
usa
portcalc
i
need
to
break
through
the
pride
barriers
and
the
not
built
here
syndrome
and
try
to
do
the
right
thing
but
i
don
t
beleive
i
can
do
that
without
you
guidance
i
m
scared
that
if
we
diverge
too
much
we
will
never
work
globally
on
these
systems
