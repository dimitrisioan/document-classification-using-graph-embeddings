vince
apparently
neil
mcgregor
became
upset
when
he
received
margaret
daffin
s
email
he
is
saying
however
that
anshuman
will
only
be
in
houston
for
one
month
and
you
had
mentioned
six
months
when
we
spoke
earlier
it
really
doesn
t
make
any
difference
since
he
will
need
to
get
an
ll
visa
under
either
circumstance
but
i
thought
you
might
want
to
see
his
email
