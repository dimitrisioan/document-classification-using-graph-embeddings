dear
jeff
this
email
is
from
robert
jarrow
cornell
and
myself
joe
cherian
i
hope
you
recall
meeting
lunching
with
bob
jarrow
me
when
you
keynoted
at
my
math
finance
day
conference
here
at
boston
university
i
wanted
to
introduce
you
to
skg
inc
a
startup
that
is
focused
on
providing
an
innovative
service
to
the
electronic
trading
community
messers
kuppuswamy
seshadhri
sriketan
mahanti
and
gaurav
mallik
are
the
principal
founders
of
skg
inc
bob
jarrow
and
i
represent
the
company
s
scientific
advisory
board
nobel
laureate
robert
merton
who
also
sat
on
our
table
during
your
keynote
address
very
kindly
serves
as
an
ad
hoc
senior
advisor
to
skg
and
has
been
an
invaluable
resource
to
skg
including
putting
us
in
touch
with
jp
morgan
coincidentally
the
c
o
o
of
jp
morgan
capital
corp
ed
colloton
in
an
april
meeting
told
us
he
would
introduce
us
to
the
c
f
o
of
enron
online
whom
he
knows
and
at
which
he
felt
skg
would
have
huge
value
adding
opportunities
however
given
ed
s
busy
travel
schedule
i
don
t
believe
he
has
been
able
to
do
that
yet
hence
this
joint
decision
by
bob
jarrow
and
myself
to
send
you
this
email
skg
s
solution
is
to
provide
dynamic
pricing
and
value
maximization
in
electronic
trading
of
securities
commodities
on
ecns
and
atss
alternative
trading
systems
it
achieves
this
through
a
process
of
strategic
negotiation
using
automated
agents
intelligent
software
manifestations
our
system
should
not
be
viewed
as
an
ecn
but
rather
as
an
enhancement
to
any
extant
trading
system
be
it
an
ecn
ats
clob
nasdaq
etc
our
initial
system
design
has
been
conducted
for
financial
instruments
trading
e
g
bonds
equities
but
our
strategy
is
as
much
applicable
to
energy
power
instruments
trading
high
speed
communications
bandwidth
trading
and
other
web
based
commodities
trading
which
we
believe
is
of
interest
to
enron
online
skg
is
superior
to
existing
solutions
in
the
following
way
it
considers
multiple
attributes
e
g
price
time
volatility
bandwidth
in
high
speed
communication
bandwidth
scenarios
for
example
the
dimensions
could
be
price
bandwidth
size
time
for
which
bandwidth
available
continguity
of
the
allocation
and
such
it
involves
dynamic
matching
as
opposed
to
static
matching
it
is
multi
lateral
it
adapts
itself
dynamically
to
changing
market
conditions
it
allows
traders
to
make
important
trade
offs
as
they
do
in
traditional
markets
currently
skg
is
involved
in
discussions
with
the
heads
of
trading
at
fidelity
putnam
investments
lehman
bros
kpmg
meridien
research
salomon
smith
barney
jp
morgan
state
street
banc
of
america
mckinsey
citizens
power
and
a
host
of
other
folks
we
think
we
have
a
value
adding
service
to
provide
to
enron
online
or
any
other
enron
subsidiary
that
the
skg
offering
matches
and
that
you
deem
fit
skg
s
founders
and
i
will
be
very
happy
to
provide
you
or
your
representative
s
with
more
details
including
a
demo
of
the
prototype
in
a
meeting
we
are
therefore
hopeful
that
you
will
be
able
to
arrange
something
appropriate
thanks
very
much
jeff
we
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
with
warm
regards
