tff
meeting
date
question
hello
from
texas
we
are
trying
to
set
up
our
meeting
date
for
the
conference
and
have
run
into
a
snag
we
can
not
get
our
san
antonio
hotel
on
the
first
weekend
in
april
as
last
year
however
we
can
get
the
hotel
and
make
all
our
fun
arrangements
for
the
second
weekend
in
april
however
this
is
easter
weekend
the
good
news
is
that
the
room
rates
are
substantially
lower
because
it
s
a
holiday
however
we
are
concerned
that
holding
the
meeting
on
this
particular
friday
saturday
will
interfere
with
family
plans
such
that
some
or
many
of
you
may
not
be
able
to
attend
my
related
question
to
you
is
this
does
holding
the
meeting
on
the
second
weekend
in
april
easter
weekend
pose
a
problem
for
you
please
give
us
your
thoughts
asap
even
if
you
think
you
may
not
be
able
to
attend
this
year
s
conference
we
need
your
opinion
to
guide
our
decision
thanks
and
i
hope
to
see
you
all
again
next
april
sometime
john
p
s
we
are
very
fortunate
to
have
enron
return
as
our
corporate
sponsor
again
this
year
