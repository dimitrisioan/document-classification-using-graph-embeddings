vince
he
seems
to
have
mostly
equity
and
fixed
income
background
and
then
some
credit
exposure
calculation
with
not
much
credit
data
analysis
experience
i
do
not
think
he
would
be
appropriate
for
bryan
s
group
he
needs
a
person
who
tracks
market
developments
and
understands
fundamental
data
and
although
this
guy
may
be
good
at
modeling
we
already
have
iris
and
amitava
doing
the
modeling
and
looking
at
data
at
this
stage
i
would
prefer
to
hire
somebody
with
direct
experience
in
credit
analysis
banking
rating
agency
i
am
worried
that
if
we
get
another
person
without
data
analysis
experience
then
amitava
will
find
himself
with
two
people
iris
being
the
other
one
who
are
both
inexperienced
in
this
area
and
he
will
find
himself
doing
a
lot
of
the
work
anyway
if
you
want
to
pursue
him
we
should
probably
do
a
phone
interview
first
