you
wrote
conrad
thanks
for
your
message
there
are
papers
enron
contributed
to
the
last
mepr
there
is
also
another
paper
on
electricity
i
contributed
to
the
red
book
on
us
power
markets
as
well
as
a
paper
or
credit
risk
management
and
a
paper
on
weather
derivatives
all
these
papers
included
in
other
risk
books
were
written
by
enron
employees
we
would
like
them
included
as
well
if
technically
possible
i
think
that
offering
other
energy
related
books
through
our
site
in
addition
to
mepr
is
fine
but
i
would
leave
the
decision
to
dan
diamond
who
is
responsible
for
the
project

dear
vince
thanks
for
the
call
and
email
on
friday
i
will
contact
masuyuki
and
follow
it
from
there
regarding
the
enron
site
i
think
it
is
absolutely
fine
to
put
up
the
two
enron
chapters
i
ll
provide
pdfs
and
prevent
any
customer
leakages
from
your
site
by
the
use
of
submit
buttons
as
mentioned
i
ll
offer
a
discount
on
mepr
to
customers
but
would
you
be
interested
in
some
of
other
energy
titles
please
let
me
know
many
thanks
