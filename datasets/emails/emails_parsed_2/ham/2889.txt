dear
fundamental
question
back

since
hope
give
convincing
answer
zimin
deriving
bs

assume
underlying
follows
gbm
ds
mu
dt
sigma
dz
mu
drift
sigma
volatility
function
use
delta
hedging

obtain

question
comes
suppose

follows
say
mean

sigma
dz
apparantly
sde
leads
different
probability
distribution
however
using
delta
hedging
argument
still
get
bs

get
bs
formula
fair
another

derive
