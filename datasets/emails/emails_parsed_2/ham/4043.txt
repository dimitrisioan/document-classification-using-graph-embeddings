efficiently
apply

multiple

approach
would
take
define
small

b
apply

say
six
models

c
include

b

e
try
determine

names
may
explain
dispersion
trader
prices
across
models
f
quantify

possible
g
try
different
set
liquid
names
repeat
process
see
decisions
last
round
still
make
sense
approach
may
define
small
set
illiquid

b
apply

c
sit

b
try

may
explain
dispersion

across

e
check
similar

f
define

building
new
fundamental
model
always
worthwhile
task
get
going
approaches
immediately
parallel
developing
new
models
may
build
new
models
added
suite
existing
models
believe
ever
single
model
answer
questions
names
rather
refine
mappings
relative
choices
among
models
time
would
mean
continuing
round
table
sessions
traders
limited
data
makes
calibration
hard
would
continually
ask
question
calibrate
throughout
discussions
may
help
guide
