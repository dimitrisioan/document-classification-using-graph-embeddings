hi
tested
cplex
xpress
mp
optimization
software
solving
network
design
problem
xpress
user
friendly
hence
takes
less
developing
time
however
cplex
performs
significantly
better
term
computation
time
especially
integer
programming
result
eventhougth
xpress
easier
use
cheaper
would
recommend
ebs
group
use
cplex
please
