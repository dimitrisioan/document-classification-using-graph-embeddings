thursday

like
spend
time
morning
getting

attendees
interests
experience
making
internet
measurements
suggest
good
way
would
group

even
interesting
need

get

perhaps
determining

even

makes

usually
many

anyway
think
fairly
interesting

measure
simple
techniques
simple

may
interesting

could
digging

highly
utilized
applications
tcp
nightmare
perfomance
wise
basic
infrastructure
things
dns
udp
probably
cover
open
udp
protocol
without
incurring
performance
penalties
would
make
completely
unusable
snmp
example
application
limited
network
service
providers
would
find
round

time
information
snmp
packets
network
management
stations
agents
useful
think
rudimentary
things
tcp
well
also
think
sites
would
interested
rudimentary
information
example
weighted
traffic
round
trip
time
distribution
tcp
traffic
networks
communicated
say
granularity
gives
sites
notion
close
talk
frequently
little
work
could
probably
make
reasonable
bandwidth
estimates
every
end
network
see
tcp
data
could
certainly
get
reasonable
number
maximum
observed

methods
also
decouple

bpf
thinking
long
time
eventually
like
skitter
tools
able
use
tcp
packets
probing
need
things
like
ip

code
properly
time
non

count
passive
tool
see
syn
syn
ack
use
tcp
port
round

time
measurements
trick
kernel
sending
tcp
packets
raw
socket
need
feedback
passive
tool
tracing
like
skitter
needs
know

difficult
simple

lot
useful

eventually
someone

desirable
enough
someone
want

instrumented

currently

even
